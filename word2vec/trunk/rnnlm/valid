this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama .  my all-time favourite actor ,  robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system ,  kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime ,  and homicidal psychosis .  the teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes ,  and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison .  but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie ,  building the fear and paranoia by degrees ,  as well as the feel of the whole california setting .  the cars are really great as well ,  as i recall .  i give this film a 10 ,  and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute .  remember ,  just because it's made-for-television doesn't mean it isn't great art . 
this is a very good ,  made for tv film .  it depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around .  the worst & most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog .  the teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family .  but boy !  ,  does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end .  the father/homeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is .  he stands up to them and protects his home and his family .  a very good actor .  . i might add .   i watched this on tv when i was like 8 or 9 .  i have never seen it again on tv and would like to .  definitely a good one !  it's the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and can't stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend .  it's the kind they just don't show anymore .   it is definitely worth seeing ! 
i saw this film on true movies  ( which automatically made me sceptical )  but actually - it was good .  why ?  not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue  ( of which there is little )  but because actually ,  despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy .   it's not dawson's creek ,  they're not graceful ,  cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge .  they're kids and they act like kids would .    they're blunt ,  awkward and annoyingly confused about everything .  yes ,  this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don't think so .  dermot mulroney gives  ( when not trying to be cool )  a very believable performance and i loved him for it .  patricia arquette is whiny and annoying ,  but she was pregnant and a teenagers ?  the combination of the two isn't exactly lavender on your pillow .  the plot was very predictable and but so what ?  i believed them ,  his stress and inability to cope - her brave ,  yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together .  i think the characters ,  acted by anyone else ,  would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't .  it reflects the surreality of the situation they're in ,  that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby .  i felt angry at her for that ,  i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her .  i felt it all .   in the end ,  i loved it and would recommend it .   watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session - career performance . 
i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school ,  and the film has stuck with me through the years .  it's not about the soundtrack ,  or cinematography ,  or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting ,  it's about the educational purpose ,  and the message behind that is the most important .  it's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school ,  and it's not really a bad thing ,  either ,  but it is a problem .  tons of girls i knew are all having children now ,  and i guess they never watched this great movie ,  and if they did ,  they clearly didn't get the message behind it all .  it's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship .  any girl can get pregnant the first time .  it's not a myth .  you don't necessarily lose out on your dreams ,  but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first .   this movie has a clear message behind it :  just say no ! 
i really thought this wasn't that bad .  not a great work of art but dermot m was the stronger performer by far .  patricia arquette was overacting much of the time .  he was actually playing cello which was very impressive ,  and his lines were never forced .  besides ,  he is an incredibly beautiful man .  really sexy .  add that to the talent ,  and most anything he's been in is a lot more tolerable .  he always gives his all even if some of the projects he's been involved in didn't quite hit the highest mark .  .  not the fault of the actor in most cases .  he's unfortunately been in some strange films that just didn't resonate at the box office .  always with a-list actors but just not always a  " hit "  .  but he is  " worth every penny "  of any dvd rented or purchased .  see the wedding date with debra messing - one of his best overall films .  worth every penny !   ;   )   ( if you haven't seen it yet ,  do ,  then you'll understand that quote !  ) 
this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b-movies :  bad porn movies without the hardcore sex .  the plot in this one isn't so bad as these things go ;  it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife .  the rest of the movie ,  however ,  leaves something to be desired .  bad acting ,  bad direction ,  bad looking woman ,  bad sets ,  bad cinematography ,  bad sound and bad sex scenes .  the filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic .  they don't even have the common sense to have gabriella hall naked or in a love scene .    how dumb is that ? 
great softcore sex ,  revealing and sexy ,  and plenty of it .  ignore the ignoramus who doesn't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way .  if you  " erotic ,  "  go watch that red shoes diary junk .  if you want hot and exciting softcore done properly ,  this is the movie to watch .  if you like the more explicit skinemax films ,  you'll like this one .  great softcore sex ,  revealing and sexy ,  and plenty of it .  ignore the ignoramus who doesn't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way .  if you  " erotic ,  "  go watch that red shoes diary junk .  if you want hot and exciting softcore done properly ,  this is the movie to watch .  if you like the more explicit skinemax films ,  you'll like this one . 
this low-budget erotic thriller that has some good points ,  but a lot more bad one .  the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife .  being a soft-core film ,  that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects .  as plots go for this type of genre ,  not to bad .  the script is okay ,  and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 am watching this not to notice too many plot holes .  but everything else in the film seems cheap .  the lead actors aren't that bad ,  but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad  ( one girl seems like she is drunk and/or high )  .  the cinematography is badly lit ,  with everything looking grainy and ugly .  the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying .  the worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it-the sex .  the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations .  the sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy ,  shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it .  the woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot .  i'm not trying to be rude or mean here ,  but they all have that breast implants and a burned out/weathered look .  even the title ,   " deviant obsession "  ,  sounds like a hardcore flick .  not that i don't have anything against porn - in fact i love it .  but i want my soft-core and my hard-core separate .  what ever happened to actresses like shannon tweed ,  jacqueline lovell ,  shannon whirry and kim dawson ?  women that could act and who would totally arouse you ?  and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry ,  nighteyes and even stripped to kill .  sure ,  none of these where masterpieces ,  but at least they felt like movies .  plus ,  they were pushing the envelope ,  going beyond hollywood's relatively prude stance on sex ,  sexual obsessions and perversions .  now they just make hard-core films without the hard-core sex . 
a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it .  i saw it on late night tv .  there are two hardcore stars in it ,  lauen montgomery and venus .  thankfully ,  gabriella hall has just a small part . 
i'll be honest with you .  .  . i liked this movie .  it's a great zombie flick that is packed with action ,  original ideas ,  good acting ,  but is also packed with bad zombie effects .  part iv ,  entitled  " after death "  is also good .  i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere .   10 out of 10  fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master ,  skinned alive ,  slumber party massacre ,  sleep away camp ,  and other full moon pictures flicks .  for other recommendations ,  check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section . 
this is one of those westerns that ,  well ,  stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog .  very few can hold up to it over the long haul .  that said ,  the rest is pretty bad .  nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch ,  junior bonner ,  and perhaps a few more .    it is riddled with weaknesses ,  john drew barrimore the most glaring .  however it does have one truly memorable scene .  nothing like it .  its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff ,  and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight .  wonderful stuff .  right up with the best in any western . 
this movie is awesome on so many levels .  .  .  and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on .   just remember this :  when you're watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies .  .  .  be they good or bad .  .  .  this is the formula that they are using .  this is what makes zombie movies so great .   and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie .  a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know .   all in all ,  it doesn't linger .  there's never a point where you think to yourself  " c'mon ,  get on with it "  .  .  .  it moves quick and corners nicely .  this is the sporty ,  little italian number of zombie flicks .   so awful ,  it's wonderful !  if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek .  .  .  rent it ,  buy it ,  love it .   as a great trivia note :  if you're watching it on dvd ,  you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen ,  underneath the musical score .  .  .  well .  .  .  that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer .  .  .  which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop . 
nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie-flicks ,  but  honestly  why would we bother ?  every single film in the zombi- " series "  delivers great fun ,  nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and  " zombi 3 "  is no exception to this ,  despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting .  this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project ,  who had to elaborate further on his  " zombi 2 "  success ,  but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films .  the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity ,  every ingenious idea from george a .  romero's  " night of the living dead "  and  " the crazies "  is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at .  yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything !  on a secret army base at the phillipines ,  scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus  " death one "  and prepare it for transport .  after a failing attempt to steal the virus ,  the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie-ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village .  the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area .  this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's  " nightmare city "  .  truly bad .  .  . but incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative zombie-madness situations .  the undead birds were original ,  for example ,  and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well .  the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick .  recommended to the fans ;  don't mind the negative reviews . 
we have high expectations with this one  .   .   .  because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci  .   .   .  however  .   .   .  its co-directed by bruno mattei  ( from night of the zombies )  and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso  ( night of the zombies )  and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies  ( hell of the living dead )  a lot .  as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2 .  fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi 2 and its editor tomassi  (  ?  )  and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi 2 its magic  .   .   .  zombi 3 is not magical  .   .   .  its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut-butter .  but over the years ,  i've grown to accept zombi 3 .  i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room  .   .   .  there was a senseless fulci-cut and the mattei/fulci-cut is the one on dvd . 
wow this was a great italian  " zombie "  movie by two great director's luci fulci  (  " zombie "  )  and bruno mattie  (  " hell of the living dead "  )  lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen  " hell of the living dead "  directed by bruno mattie and if you saw  " zombie "  directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great  " zombie "  make-up witch equals great looking  " zombies "  has a funny  " zombie "  flying head ! and  " zombie "  birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a  " zombie "   ( that only happed to two people )  but they are mainly just the great toxic  " zombies "  like in bruno matties  " hell of the living dead "  . so if you like italian  " zombie "  movies or just  " zombie "  movie's in general than check this one out its a great italian  " zombie "  movie ! 
a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon ,  and in the process of trying to escape ,  he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised .  soldiers are able to retrieve the case ,  but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out .  they eventually make it to where he's hiding ,  and  " cleanse "  the hotel and its occupants .  unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation ,  and if you've seen return of the living dead ,  you know what happens next .   zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike ,  as a complete mess of a movie .  while that's a fair assessment ,  it's not without it's high points .  for one thing ,  it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy .  there's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible .  they're in the water ,  the rafters of houses ,  hiding in trees ,  and for some reason ,  they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush ,  only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape .  there's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator .  you have to see it to believe it ,  as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo .  it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting ,  especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i've seen ,  but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie .  sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't require anything more than your time and an open mind .  zombi 3 fits that bill ,  and then some .  it's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers ,  and watch it with some like minded friends .  i give it an 8/10 ,  just because of sheer enjoyment . 
yeah sure it's cheesy ,  it's not zombie ,  but it's not that bad either .  it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus ,  and it's entertaining .  i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience ,  as he was never completely satisfied with it .  it is well worth a search out ,  especially for genre and fulci fans .  it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand . 
off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don't make statements like the above lightly .  secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to bruno  ( rats ,  night of terror )  mattei .  this is no dawn of the dead folks .   that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen .    the script is wonderfully horrible .  just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote  (  " let's try putting these two molecules together "  )  .    the zombies come in all varieties .  from moaning shufflers ,  to machete wielding maniacs ,  to birds !    the gore is plentiful .  legs are bitten off ,  arms amputated ,  stomachs burst open .    the pace is fast ,  flying from one zombie attack to the next .    then there's the head in the fridge .  oh the head in the fridge !  one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2 .   you should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film .  get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night .   did i mention the head in the fridge ?  !  ?  !  ? 
although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor  ( zombi 2 )  i actually like this one better .  this is because of it's faster pace ,  better settings ,  and cool 80's soundtrack .  it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci .  the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good .  it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness ;  for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas .  some are braindead while others say funny lines ,  but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror ?  there's even a flying zombie head !  how rad is that ?  definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans .  it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well .  also check out zombi 4 . 
zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making .  firstly ,  it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2 ,  with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a .  romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi .  confusing enough ?  basically ,  none of the films have anything to do with one another ,  but who cares when they make money .  i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out .  bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time .   zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare .  scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines ,  terrorists steal it unleashing a plague ,  and zombie run amok .  the scientists want to create an antidote ,  while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice .  there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet .    overall ,  i actually liked this film .  i heard horrible things ,  but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable .  the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution ,  corrupted military ,  man playing god ,  etc .  i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film ,  but it veered off in a weird direction ,  presumably when mattei came on board .   besides ripping off other zombie flicks ,  this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies .  you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with ,   " when you see the men in white suits & gas masks ,  run to them for help .  "  this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies .  later ,  they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular ,  uncontaminated people is killed by mistake .   the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner .  how is it cool ?  let me count the ways1 .  zombie birth 2 .  flying zombie head 3 .  zombie birds .  4 .  zombie with no legs swimming in a pool .  my favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station .  he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl .   favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie ,  the scientists asks ,   " don't you think that once the ash is in the air ,  it will fall to the ground ,  and contaminate everything ?  "  to which the sargeant boldly replies ,   " now you're talking science fiction .  "  he also continues to mention the  " science fiction "  told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies .   extras :  gallery ,  trailers ,  and interviews ,  most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes ,  yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details .   bottom line :  a must see for zombie and fulci fans .   rating :  7/10  molly celaschi www . horroryearbook . com myspace . com/horroryearbook
i think this film has much to recommend it ,  particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr .  foxx .  although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very ,  very hard to follow in some cases ,  all in all ,  it makes for a nice time in front of the tube . 
born again is a okay episode of season 1 .  the reincarnation bit ,  in my opinion ,  is cool .  the more i watch it ,  the more i like it ,  yet it will never rise above 'very good' for me .  even though it is not very memorable ,  i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode .  anyway ,  now i will say what is good and bad about this episode ,   the good :  oragami .  oh yeah !   that fish tank was nice .  =]  thrown out of a window .  very classy .  x]  the bad :  marry your best friend's wife !  ?  o_o  what a random pick to reincarnate .   why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up ,  try to take his scarf off instead ?   conclusion :  okay episode ,  not very memorable .  7/10
hmmm ,  yeah this episode is extremely underrated .   even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts .  i think the good over wins the bad .    i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end .  i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony .  it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 .    for some reason ,  people have always hated the reincarnation episodes ,  yet i have always liked them .  they're not the best ,  in terms of writing .  but the theme really does interest me ,   i'm gonna give it a three star ,  but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four . 
born again the limerick :    if a man could come back from the dead   and live in a little girl's head   revenge he would get   for the murder he met  by the guy that's now in his wife's bed .   for me born again is a highly under-rated ,  classic episode that makes up a part of what defined the x-files for me before i started watching it .  i saw a few segments before when the show first came on and i was much too young to watch it such as parts of the jersey devil ,  but i very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl .  i tell you i couldn't sleep for weeks !  for this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that i have since grown to enjoy .  its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge .  or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night .  you'd think her parents would have been worried .  and maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story .  and was was with the telekinesis ?  other than adding the really cool carrie factor to the already creepy story ,  there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it .  but even with its little flaws ,  in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it .  10 out of 10 . 
i love cartoons .  they can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more .  they can push the boundaries of satire  ( 'the simpsons' )  ,  good taste  ( 'south park' )  ,  spectacle  ( 'aladdin' )  ,  or reality  ( 'toy story' )  .  there are some good examples of this in 'ice age' ,  such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside ,  chatting like old friends .  such scenes are a pleasure to watch ,  as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time ,  usually in a way that makes us laugh .  while ice age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time ,  it's a really fun film .  sit back ,  enjoy the deliberate anachronisms ,  the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs .   the story follows manfred the grumpy mammoth ,  sid ,  an idiotic sloth ,  and diego ,  a sabretooth tiger ,  as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons .  on the way ,  naturally ,  they have a whole lot of problems .  also popping up throughout the journey is scrat ,  history's unluckiest rodent ,  who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter :  in glaciers ,  on top of dead trees ,  in ice-caves .  his opening scene is a classic .   it's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in ,  but some of the scenes ,  such as the nappy-changing or the dodos ,  are hilarious ,  the animals are likeable and it looks good .  there is one quite touching moment too ,  when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of manfred's eyes .   not a must-see ,  but good for a fun hour or so .   7/10
a glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001 :  a space odyssey .  miles apart in vision ,  but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless .  a magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn .  you've probably seen this scene in the trailer ,  but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and ,  results ,  an avalanche .  the horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible .    the movie traces two characters ,  a mammoth named manfred  ( ray romano )  and a buck-toothed sloth  ( john leguizamo )  as they try to migrate south .  they find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them .  they are joined by a saber tiger named diego  ( denis leary )  whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan ,  by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap .  diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all ,  but diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end .    there are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip ,  including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in shrek .  characters contemplate on why they're in the ice age ,  while they could have called it the big chill or the nippy era .  some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming .  another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends :  `all the great guys are never around .  the sensitive ones get eaten . ' throwaway lines galore ,  whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch .  also ,  food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as `good eating . '   the vocal talents of romano ,  leguizamo and leary make good on their personas ,  while the children will delight in their antics ,  the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents .  there is some mild violence and intense content ,  but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil ,  and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties .  the animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic .   
*may contain spoilers* *may contain spoilers*  in the age of shrek ( the movie )  & pixar ( the studio )  ,  this is a much more traditional animation film .  it put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together ( not to mentioned ,  try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father )  .  they begin as enemies and end as best friend .  if this sound like a disney film ,  it is ( only made through 20th century fox )  .  the trailer to the movie was one of the best i've seen in ages ,  but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set .  the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film .  yes ,  there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children .  the parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min .  their children's attention is focused on something else than them .  the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film .  children will love this film ,  adults will only like it . 
there are very few movies that are so funny as this one .  i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater  " reserved "  for movie buffs like me ,  so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes .  .  .   at times the story was a bit  " slow "  ,  but that is perhaps for the best - a bit of rest in-between the rolling amongst the aisles  ( i nearly fell out of the seat .  .  .  )  was most welcome . 
i am not going to lie ,  this is a great movie .  i saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre .  i saw it a second time ,  and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes .  sid  ( the sloth )  is not all that flattering ,  but diego  ( a mountain lion ,  i think )  is really good in the movie .  the animation is outstanding ,  and the story has a touching ending .  it is worth taking kids 10 and under to ,  but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring .  also ,  the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting .  like i said ,  it is a pretty good movie ,  but i would rate  " toy story 2 "  or  " shrek "  higher .  8/10
ok ,  at the beginning it looked like  " shrek "  - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief .  then it evolves into something really compelling ,  as the gauntlet is set .  and the result is an enjoyable movie ,  which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch  ( manny's past ,  for example )  .  the premise has been obviously worked for a long time ,  so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets  ( only ice caps and rocks )  ,  and three characters .  it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it .  as i said ,  it can be tear-jerking at some times ,  so ,  kids ,  be warned .  the real letdown is the animation .  this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek ,  and it shows .  the humans are unrealistic ,  and we have seen better examples of cgi before .  but don't let this stain the record :  as a solo effort ,   " ice age "  is commendable .  and it will gather many fans ,  i have no doubt .  oh and yes ,  the moments with that small mouse are priceless ,  and show-stealing . 
had fun watching this film .  .  despite the feeling i got a lot of the time ,  that this film was almost copying monsters inc .  there're quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two ,  the relationship between an animal/monster and a small child ,  other animals trying to break that relationship ,  etc .  it felt like that pretty much throughout the film ,  to me .   one of the redeeming features though ,  is scrat  :  )  very very funny character ,  even if he serves no purpose  :  ) 
i happened across  " bait "  on cable one night just as it started and thought ,   " eh ,  why not ?  "  i'm glad i gave it a chance .     " bait "  ain't perfect .  it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness .  but overall ,  this movie worked .  all the elements aligned just right ,  and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film .    most of that ,  i think ,  is due to jamie foxx .  i don't know who tagged foxx for the lead ,  but whoever it was did this movie a big favor .  believable and amazingly likeable ,  foxx glides through the movie ,  smooth as butter and funnier than hell .  you can tell he's working on instinct ,  and instinct doesn't fail him .   the plot ,  while unimportant ,  actually ties together pretty well ,  and there's even a character arc through which foxx's character grows as a person .  again ,  they could've slipped by without any of this ,  but it just makes things that much better .   i'm surprised at the low rating for this .  maybe i just caught this move on the right night ,  or vice versa ,  but i'd give it a 7/10 .  bravo ,  mssr .  foxx . 
i looked at this movie with my child eyes ,  and i wasn't disappointed .  the story is well-known ,  some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio  ( mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal )  .  .  .  and i don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut .  this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture .   briefly  :  it works ,  it is funny and it is a  " must-see "  with your children  ( they'll like it )  . 
when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film .  and when i had ,  i kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied .  it was a great movie ,  don't get me wrong ,  but i think the great parts where already in the trailers ,  if you catch my drift .  it went very fast and it rolled on ,  so i was never bored ,  and i enjoyed watching it .  the humor was absolutely great .  my first contact with a sloth  (  .  . or something like it )  . 
an interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger ,  a sloth ,  and a mammoth ,  who saved a baby ,  who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age .  the morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end .  one of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby ,  who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community .  the baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth ,  but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby .  they went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger ,  and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth .  at the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs . 
shrek ,  anyone ?  well ,  imagine shrek in the ice age .  remember the ending of shrek ?  of cause you do .  now ,  imagine ,  that shrek turns into a human ,  and so does the princess .  get it ?  nice animation ,  actually ,  much more of an art work than pixar and disney pictures ,  which are trying to get as close to reality as possible in their drawings .  strong one-liners ,  some social comments that kids won't understand ,  the good guys win .  one thing more :  scrat .  by the way ,  how does everybody know his name is scrat ?  7/10
no day passes without a new released computer animated movie ,  so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects .  after watching ice age i felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre .   but it's because i am a big guy now ,  and i am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children  ( maybe up to 14 )  .  the story is quite simple ,  and the  " actors "  are funny in a cute way ,  without any crude or complex humour .  even the  " evil "  is lovely ,  fluffy big cat with those funny teeth .  and the story has a happy end ,  which was a small disappointment for me  ( knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way )  but a great thing for children .  and apart from some fights nobody dies  ( not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth ,  several times )  ,  which made a cartoony feeling .   the computer animation part is nice but nothing special ,  apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes ,  when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics .  [which means lots of work nevertheless ! ]  there were some gags which made me smile - i accept ,  the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and  ( in my opinion )  better left unnoticed ,  since it does not feel to fit into the story .   overall it's a nice movie ,  but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche .  if you don't hate cute animals making funny things ,  watch it at least once . 
the movie itself was ok for the kids .  but i gotta tell ya that scratch ,  the little squirrel ,  was the funniest character i've ever seen .  he makes the movie all by himself .  he's the reason i've just love this movie .  congradulations to the crew ,  it made me laugh out loud and always will ! 
i can't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they won't like it .  my mom likes violent movies ,  so why did she see it ?  she rated it just to bring down the rating .  so i know that's why it didn't have a higher rating .  i give it a 6/10
this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen .  usually ,  the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them .  not ice age .  i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with scrat ,  the hilarious sabertooth squirrel .   ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch .  the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby ,  set 20 , 000 years in the past .  the visuals were great .  simply beautiful .  it's one thing to create convincing aninmation ,  it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals .  blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future . 
 ( spoilers ?  ?  )   i wasn't sure what to think of the movie .  not too much of a kids film .  definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying .  but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it .   i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had .   ( even less without the credits )  and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature .  but alas ,  they torture him .  right until the end of the movie .  those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars .  but i do recommend the movie .  even for a sequel .   8/10  quality :  9/10 entertainment :  7/10 replayable : 7/10
while i loved this movie ,  the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high .   i own the dvd ,  so don't get me wrong ,  i am not saying don't watch it or even buy it !  it's just that i still think the first scene was the best ,  and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it . 
this film resembles in many ways `enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman ,  as we have an innocent  ( black )  man being pursued by the `government' with all the modern technology known to man .  usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster .  that does not apply here .  of course i love everything david morse does ,  so maybe my comments are not fair ,  but there were more good things about this film then that .  the main baddy ,  played by doug hutchison ,  was brilliant ,  and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli .  our hero ,  alvin sanders  ( played by jamie foxx )  ,  was however irritating most of the part .  he is so out of place ,  cracking bad jokes ,  evoking no sympathy from the audience .  or not to begin with ,  the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you  ( and on his followers as well !  )  .  i didn't expect much when i rented it ,  but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits .  7/10
i wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie ,  since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems .  that doesn't make it bad ,  just not something i'd go far .   it is a little saccharine ,  so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for-kids movie like this .   however ,  all of that goes out the window when that squirrel  ( the one in all the trailers )  comes on-screen .  his time is limited ,  but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey ,  could you stick in a little more squirrel ? ' every time it's getting intolerably dull .  that doesn't save the movie ,  but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where i couldn't stop laughing . '  and of course ,  visually it won't disappoint ,  but that's almost a given with pixar flicks .  of all of their stuff ,  i'd put this at the bottom .  .  . but that isn't in itself bad . 
ice age is not only animation of the year  ( in my eyes )  it's also the best animated feature i've ever seen !   the teaser excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website .  scrat is cool !  and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes .   the animation is superb .  your heart really goes out to the characters in this film .  they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed .  it's hard to say which one really steals the picture .   i experienced their journey with laughter ,  tears and amazement .  nothing was forced or over done .  the emotion was genuine ,  especially in the dramatic second half .  the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997 ,  also a fox production .  and before that it was the land before time 1988 .  all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience ,  not just the cynics .  10/10   
this movie had no parts that were hilarious ,  mostly just average funny units ,  but it did not have any parts that were really bad either .  the worst part was the voice of sid .  his slothy slur was just too much for me .  by about 5 minutes in i was sick of hearing him talk .  aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good .  there were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better .  this is a good movie for kids .  it has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids .  this one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them . 
if you like jamie foxx ,  ( alvin sanders )  ,  " date from hell "  , '01 ,  you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp ,   ( jumbo size )  and at the same time lots of gold bars .  alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw ,  and david morse ,  ( edgar clenteen )  ,   " hack "  '02 tv series ,  decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals .  there is lots of laughs ,  drama ,  cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard .  jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture . 
 " ice age "  is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by blue sky studios and released in 2002 as the company's first .  we are introduced to the main characters :  a squirrel named scrat  ( voiced by chris wedge ,  and please note :  the sound of scrat's screams is the sound of tom's screams from the  " tom and jerry "  cartoons )  ,  a woolly mammoth named manny  ( voiced by ray romano of  " everybody loves raymond "  )  ,  a sloth named sid  ( voiced by john leguizamo of  " titan a .  e .  "  )  ,  and a saber toothed tiger named diego  ( voiced by denis leary of pixar's  " a bug's life "  )  .   the movie opens with scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that ,  he caused an avalanche .  we then see a herd going south for the coming ice age  ( except for manny ,  who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him )  .  sid comes out of his cave yawning ,  and saw that his family abandoned him .  he then pays toll with some aardvarks .  unfortunately ,  he gets pursued by sylvia  ( voiced by kirsten johnston of  " 3rd rock from the sun "  )  ,  a female orange sloth ,  who wants sid to go migrating with her .  sid eventually teams up with manny ,  and they became friends .   meanwhile ,  nearby a human tribe ,  soto  ( voiced by goran visnjic )  ,  an evil saber toothed tiger ,  wants revenge against the tribe's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son ,  roshan ,  away from him .  in the morning ,  he ,  diego ,  and soto's henchmen ,  lenny  ( voiced by alan tudyk )  ,  oscar  ( voiced by diedrich bader )  ,  and zeke  ( voiced by jack black )  attacked the tribe ,  but the leader's wife escaped with roshan and gave him to manny and sid to look after .  eventually ,  diego joins them ,  and went on a journey to return roshan back to his tribe ,  who are also looking for him as well .  relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out ,  okay ?  besides manny ,  sid ,  diego ,  scrat ,  sylvia ,  and roshan ,  the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that roshan's tribe are using ,  and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named jennifer  ( voiced by jane krakowski )  ,  and a skinny female yellow sloth named rachel  ( voiced by lorri bagley )  ,  to whom sid shows them roshan as they relax in a tar pit .  incidentally ,  the two rhinos ,  carl  ( voiced by cedric the entertainer of pdi's  " madagascar "  )  ,  and frank  ( voiced by stephen root of pixar's  " finding nemo "  )  ,  who go after sid for ruining their meal and confront manny on a cliff ,  are simple minor characters .  same went for the dodos ,  who are using melons as their food supply .   the gags in this movie are very funny .  for instance ,  manny talks through his trunk saying ,   " i'm not going !  "  when jennifer and rachel are out of the tar pit ,  sid asks jennifer  " what do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens ?  "  jennifer then responds to him ,   " what do you say if you go jump into the tar pit !  ?  "  rachel also then kicks sid in the waist .  sylvia sees diego holding sid by the neck with his teeth ,  then she asks sid if he's holding his breath ,  tells diego to eat him ,  and promptly walks off .   since  " ice age "  is not only a success ,  but it has 2 sequels :  the first one was  " ice age :  the meltdown "  ,  which was released in 2006 ,  and the other was  " ice age :  dawn of the dinosaurs "  ,  which is going to be releasing next year .  i can hardly die waiting to see what  " ice age :  dawn of the dinosaurs "  will be like . 
finally i got to see the infamous  " ice age "  .  apart from maybe not being as dead funny as i'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word i can say about it .  sure ,  it's not as glamorous as a disney production ( besides ,  it is fox's 1st attempt at a full length cg movie )  but it's got immense heart and on some occasions ( like the look in manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past )  i found myself on the verge of tears .  but when they reunited the baby with its father i just couldn't hold them in anymore .  a movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it ;  the end result being one of the most touching animated creations i have ever seen .  great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you ( and great voice talents as well )  and many funny memorable scenes ,  especially from scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go .  plus the dodo scene ,  which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002 .   i honestly don't get it ,  but for some reason it really looks like cg animation will be taking the upper hand in the future .  but if it just means that there will be more movies like this one  ( and who can forget pixar's creations )  then i don't really mind ,  at least for now .  9/10
i thought that ice age was an excellent movie !  as a woman of 30 ,  with no children ,  i still seem to really enjoy these humorous ,  witty animated movies .  sid is the best character i have seen in some time ,  better than bartok in anastasia  ( although he was really humorous ,  and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten )  and even more humorous than melman in madagascar .  i have seen the movie at least 15 times  ( i own it obviously )  and i quote the movie at work  ( on many occasions .  .  . yes , still )  .  my favourite scene is the part where sid says  " oh ,  oh ,  oh ,  i love this game !  "  and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the  " tigers "  .  .  .  " pack of wolves ,  pack of bears ,  pack of fleas ,  pack of whiskers ,  pack of noses ,  pack a derm ?  ,  pack of lies ,  pack of troubles ,  pack a wallop ,  pack of birds ,  pack of flying fish .  .  .  "  or however that part goes !  that is the funniest part about the whole movie ,  although i also really enjoyed the humour behind  " putting sloths on the map "  and many other parts as well .  the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is  " brother bear "  . 
i watched 'ice age'in the movie theater and i liked the movie .  spite of the fact that 'ice age'has many flaws and scientific errors , like humans , sabers , dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period ,  and even the location of where the story passes ( looks north america , but has some characteristics from iceland for example )  we can have fun even so .  ( unless you are very severe !  )    the planet is entering an ice age ,  and many animals are immigrating to the south where is warmer .  sid is a stupid sloth that is left behind by his own family ,  that can't stand him any longer . walking in his way ,  he meets manfred , or how he calls '' manny'' a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and is going to the north .  worried that he can easily be captured ,  sid decides to follow manfred ,  and in the middle of their journey ,  they found a human mother with her baby .  the mother dies but manfred and sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans .  diego ,  one of the sabers ,  decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human's camp .  what manfred and sid does not know ,  is that diego is from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby ,  and also pretend to betray they both to make they become saber's food .  what will happen ,  will depend of diego's behavior and conscience .  .  .   aka  " a era do gelo "  - brazil
i saw the movie with two grown children .  although it was not as clever as shrek ,  i thought it was rather good .  in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break ,  there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it .  there parents also seemed engaged .  the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments .  hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids .  as such ,  it was successful although i liked it too .  personally i liked the scrat !  ! 
just saw ice age ,  a very funny and especially nice looking film .  the story is simple but effective ,  the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design .   more inspired by traditional animated movies than reality ,  the designs give you a really ,  really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour .  sometimes the touches of reality shine through  ( especially the water was impressive )  ,  but nonetheless ,  it's a fantasy-world based on reality .  including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering .   pixar films shine with technical brilliance ,  this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how .   enough technical babble ,  the film's entertaining ,  family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny . 
i first saw ice age in the subiaco cinemas when it came out ,  back in '02 .  i was only 13 at the time ,  but even then i liked it .  it had some sort of warmth .   we've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it ,  it never gets boring .  this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time - the characters have no particular 'home' which they leave .  they are nomads ,  and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch .   also ,  each individual character on the surface ,  appear to be just putting up with each other ,  but they're really all good friends .  as well ,  all of the characters have their own charms  ( even the bad guys )  .  sid the sloth is charming in his annoying ,  over-affectionate and naive sort of way .  manny is adorable in his depressed ,  reclusive character ,  and so on and so forth .   another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation .  all the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay ,  giving the film an artistic edge .   another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie ,  is that gender means very little .  there are hardly any female characters ,  but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film .  due to this ,  there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age .   all in all ,  ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before shrek 2 and the incredibles came out . 
this is obviously aimed at the same market as monsters inc and shrek ,  but is different in its less cartoony feel  ( despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures )  .  the story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end  ( its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves )  but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different  " animals .  "  you know the outcome ,  but you can't help being drawn in .    the characters themselves are far more than their voices  ( the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices )  ,  unlike most disney movies .  they are well rounded and completely believable ,  strangely .  the group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable .  you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think .    the animation is brilliant ,  as you would expect ,  and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie .  you will fall in love with the characters ,  especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts .  i came out wanting the obligatory merchandise ,  especially the sloth toy ,  only to be disappointed the next day when i couldn't find anything vaguely related .   which ,  strangely ,  makes the movie all the more pure .    better than monsters inc or shrek . 
i'd have to say this is one of the best animated films i've ever seen .  i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing ,  just a few weeks ago .  i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office .  apparently ,  a lot of people liked this movie .   a gorgeous color palette  ( man ,  this looks good )  and a lot of good adult  ( but clean )  humor make this a big winner .  the opening 3-4-minute scene with  " scat ,  "  is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him .   " sid "  the sloth  ( voiced by john leguizano )  ,  however ,  provides the main humor in the movie .  he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie .   ray romano is the voice of the mammoth ,  the big character of the film ,  literally ,  while denis leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger  this isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice ,  sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters .  this isn't interrupted with a lot of songs ,  either :  one only brief one and there is nothing offensive ,  language-wise .   if more animated movies were this good ,  i'd own more . 
with a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at fox animation and blue sky studios have done an incredible job .   they have combined state-of-the-art digital animation ,  the perfectly cast voice talents of ray romano ,  john leguizamo and dennis leary  ( among many others )  to create a highly entertaining ,  family film with a strong message about cooperation ,  friendship and caring for your fellow herd members .  and how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd .   while watching this film i got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders !   david newman -- yet another member of the newman family of hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and ,  at times ,  is positively toe tapping .   the overall look of the film is incredible ;  an intensely coloured ,  strangely believable fantasyland of snow ,  geysers ,  mud ,  rocks and ice .  the individual characters were delightfully believable too ,  with the facial expressions of ray romano's manfred' being a particular treat .   the entire sequence with the dodos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `dumb as a dodo comes from . '  this is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless .   it would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home . 
return to the lost world was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of the lost world .   in this sequel ,  the same five people ,  lead by challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land .  gomez has something to do with this .  they manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved ,  much to the delight of the natives .   like in the lost world ,  what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a t-rex and ankylosaurus .   john ryhs-davies and david warner reprise their roles as challenger and summerlee and three of the other actors are also back .   despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs ,  i enjoyed return to the lost world .   rating :  3 stars out of 5 . 
once again the two bickering professors must join together to save the lost world .  the five members of the first expedition return  ( see the lost world ,  1992 ,  for a list of actors )  .  a man seeking oil brings a drilling crew to the plateau .  instead of striking oil they tap an underground volcano which threatens all life in the lost world .  the oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition .  although the situation looks hopeless .  .  .  .   ( i'm not going to tell you the ending )  . 
lily mars ,  a smalltown girl living in indiana ,  dreams of making it big on broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful broadway producer john thornway returns to his hometown for a visit .  lily tries everything she can to get thornway to notice her ,  but he just gets annoyed with her antics .  when thornway goes back to new york to stage his show ,  lily follows  ( unknown to john of course )  and thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show ,  only as a favor to her family ,  however thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms ,  which makes the show's leading lady ,  isabel rekay ,  jealous .  when isabel gets fed up with the john-lily romance causing friction with the show ,  she leaves ,  and john decides to make lily the star .  isabel returns later ,  and thornway is forced to tell lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play ,  which also may jeopardize the romance .  very charming film ,  and a refreshing change to see garland put the comedic touches into her role  ( her reading of lady macbeth ,  while supposed to be humorous ,  never threatened her singing career )  i enjoyed heflin's character  ( thornway )  more when he was annoyed with lily rather than be the romantic .  the film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together ,  but a very enjoyable film .  rating ,  7 . 
in this 1943 film ,  judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-van heflin .  this film was certainly a big change for mr .  heflin ,  especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in  " johnny eager .  "   wasn't spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children ,  with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren ?   the singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired .  it was a gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer . 
presenting lily mars  ( mgm ,  1943 )  is a cute film ,  but in my opinion it could have been better .  judy garland is great as always ,  but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quickly .   i mean ,  one minute he's ready to beat her butt ,  but the next minute he falls in love with her .  i believe that this production ,  the film editing ,  and the script  (  even though the photography was great ,  the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well )  could have been a little better .  it feels as though the production was too rushed .    the supporting cast was good as well ,  especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie .  she at the age of 11 ,  looks really cute and it's a shame that she didn't develop into a teenage comic actress .  she's much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930's  ( except for broadway musketeers 1938 ,  she's really good in that )  ,  when they tried to make her into a shirley temple/sybil jason hybrid .  overall ,  this film could better ,  but in the end ,  judy gave it her all . 
presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland ,  along with her standard singing moments .  the plot consists of lily mars tagging along after producer john thornway for her big break .  i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here .  i really recommend this film for everyone .  judy is breathtaking in this role ! 
  presenting lily mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system .  ok now that you know my bias ,  here are some reasons i think this movie does stand out .   1 .  although the basic plot - lily mars  ( judy garland )  goes to new york ,  becomes a star ,  and wins the heart of her director  ( van heflin )  is a pretty stock hollywood story of the period ,  the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual .  although lily gets her big break when the star quits ,  she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show .   2 .  judy garland  ( enough said !  )   3 .  the supporting cast includes some really great performances .  spring byington as lily's mother is truely wonderful ,  as is fay bainter  ( the mother of the director - john thornway  ( van heflin )  )  .  the standout supporting performance though goes to character actress connie gilchrist as frankie ,  a one time actress turned theater custodian .   worth a watch for sure .  one of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams . 
almost every review of this movie i'd seen was pretty bad .  it's not pretty bad ,  it's actually pretty good ,  though not great .  the judy garland character could have gotten annoying ,  but she didn't allow it to .  somewhere along the line ,  i've become a fan of brooding ,  overbearing ,  overacting van heflin ,  at least in the early 40's .  judy's singing is great ,  but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship .  i gave it a 7 . 
the movie is great and i like the story .  i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell  (  sick movie  )  and highlander  (  silly movie  )  .  i just tell the truth ,  i like a reality hehe and also a true story  :  )   
presenting lily mars may have provided judy garland with one of the easier roles she had while at mgm because lily mars is definitely a character she could identify with .  a young girl with talent enough for ten ,  she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer van heflin from her home town discourages her .   i really liked judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater .  because it is judy garland with the talent of judy garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes van heflin nearly the whole movie to be convinced .   both judy and heflin hail from the same small town ,  heflin's dad was the town doctor who delivered her and heflin while he may have moved away and become a big producer on broadway ,  their respective moms ,  fay bainter and spring byington have kept in touch .  that's her entrée ,  but heflin's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids ,  but never anyone quite like lily mars .   no real big song hits came out of presenting lily mars for garland ,  though she sings all her numbers .  the best in the film is a revival of that gaslight era chestnut ,  every little movement has a meaning all its own .  judy sings it with connie gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a broadway theater where heflin's show is being produced .  gilchrist was a star back in the days of the floradora girls and she and judy deliver the song in grand style with connie .  it's the best scene in the film as gilchrist encourages judy to keep at it .  composer karl hoschna had died a long time ago ,  but lyricist otto harbach was still alive and i'm betting he liked what he heard .   european musical star marta eggerth is in presenting lily mars as the show's star who's at first bemused ,  then angry and finally ,  understanding of garland and heflin .  she did a couple of films with mgm and then went back to europe for more work on the continent .  i'm betting mgm didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick hungarian accent ,  though louis b .  mayer never met a soprano he didn't like .   van heflin does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from garland and eggerth .  heflin was just coming off his oscar for johnny eager the previous year and he and garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team ,  but they're not bad together .   presenting lily mars is a fine showcase for the talents of judy garland .  and she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage film with mickey rooney . 
this film was made in 1943 when i think judy was at her peak  ( looks wise )  .  in her previous film for me and my gal people often say that she looks emaciated .  well in this film she looks perfect .  she is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy .   i think this film is hilarious ,  especially at the beginning when she is trying to arrange an audition with john thornway .  one of the funniest scene's in my opinion is judy's rendition of lady macbeth and when john is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking  ( lol )  .   one criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when john and lily fall in love .  i mean one minute he despises her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love .   another point i didn't like was on opening night .  if i were lily i would be furious with john but she isn't .  .  . it just doesn't make sense .   but all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect . 
in the hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town ,  partied pretty hardy .  after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the usa .    the drovers who worked for trail boss gil favor as played by eric fleming were no different .  but fleming was a man of all business ,  he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it .    with the long run of rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part ,  we got to know all the drovers at some point .  a some point story lines were focused around all of them ,  though the bulk were with fleming and clint eastwood's character rowdy yates ,  the number 2 guy with the herd .   clint eastwood's western image was molded by rawhide ,  it's a shame that these are not shown more often .  probably because they were done in black and white .  had this been an nbc show ,  this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are .  we'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend .   ironically enough it was eric fleming who left the show before it closed to do films .  he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name .  sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film ,  drowned in a river .  had he lived he might have become a name like eastwood's .   clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run .  and he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre .   rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it .  no frills in this one ,  these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year .   they really don't make television series like these any more .  what a pity . 
currently on metoo's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays ,  right after  " maverick "  and right before  " wild ,  wild west "   ( followed by  " star trek "  )  .   don't know if i ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on ,  but i'm really captivated by it .  offbeat ,  unusual ,  surreal stories set in a mythical west .  kind of the  " naked city "  of westerns .   and the guest stars are there :  dan duryea ,  lyle bettger ,  brian donlevy ,  macdonald carey ,  rick jason  ( as a treacherous mexican )  ,  a young dick van patten ,  jack lord ,  noah berry ,  jr .   ( as a colorful mexican )  ,  martha hyer ,  marguerite chapman ,  even ann robinson  (  " war of the worlds "  )  ,  gloria talbott  (  " i married a monster from outer space "  )   it ran for eight seasons ,  over 200 episodes ,  from january ,  1959 ,  to december ,  1965 .   eric fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss gil favor ,  the most stolid man that's ever lived ,  with the code of honor of a samurai ,  and just the right balance between toughness and open-handedness .  i would vote for him for president any day .   ( p . s .  he had a very interesting biography :  http : //www . imdb . com/name/nm0281661/  )   and a young clint eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand ,   " rowdy "  yates .  also ,  veteran western actor and country music figure  ( the immortal  " one-eyed ,  one-horned ,  flying purple people eater "  )  sheb wooley is there as seasoned scout pete nolan .  and paul brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as  " wishbone "  .   and then there's that great theme song ,  performed by the immortal frankie laine .   ( between that and the  " maverick "  theme ,  i've got western theme songs running through my head all day .  )   i look forward to every episode ;  i'm collecting the whole set .  a good time  ( not to mention a moo-ving experience )  is always guaranteed ,  as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial .    " rollin' ,  rollin' ,  rollin'  .   .   .   " 
it ran 8 seasons ,  but it's first ,  in early 1959 ,  and it's last ,  in the autumn of 1965 ,  were shorter than seasons 2-7 .  cbs chief william paley canceled rawhide's production after watching the 1st show of season 8 ,  in september ,  1965 ,  because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor ,  who had departed after season 7 .  the last new episode aired in november ,  1965 .  the lone 1966 cbs broadcast ,  on january 4 ,  1966 ,  was a rerun .    i have often wondered why rawhide didn't switch to color filming for it's last season ?  most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 .  cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn ,  for many of their sitcoms ,  but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white .  gunsmoke was the last western  ( and last prime time network series to switch to color )  on september 17 ,  1966 ,  for the episode snap decision . 
rawhide was a wonderful tv western series .  focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss gil favor .  most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of favor and his men .  guest stars came and went but unlike wagon train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in .  rawhide was a true ,  gritty western and gil favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten .  thanks to eric fleming's performance the show became a massive hit .  of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - clint eastwood ,  sheb wooley ,  paul brinegar ,  steve raines ,  james murdoch ,  rocky shahan ,  robert cabal .  all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history .  rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me ,  as yet anyhow ,  managed to do so .  later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines .  for me some of the time this didn't work - the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories .  however there were still some classic stories and rawhide remained top drawer affair .  the black and white photography added to a bleak ,  realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture .  rustlers ,  indians , commancheroes ,  beautiful damsels in distress ,  serial killers ,  they all showed up to give our heroes problems .  the end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through .  the reason - eric fleming had departed and rawhide was now a head without a body - the gritty realism was gone ,  gil favor commanded respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting .  we shall not see his like again .  watch an episode whenever you can ,  they seldom disappoint . 
young erendira and her tyrranical grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world .  this interpretation of gabriel garcia marquez' " la incréible y triste historia da la cándida eréndira ,  .  .  .  "  may not rub marquez purists the right way eventhough the story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work .  the strength of this film is in its acting especially papas as the grandmother .  marquez fans and marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt . 
this is a gorgeous movie visually .  the images of the mexican desert ,  the old mansion ,  the characters in their picturesque costumes .  .  . all amount to a real work of art .   the story seems a bit loose ,  but that's because it's not meant to be realistic .  it is taken from a book called one hundred years of solitude ,  and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated ,  otherworldly atmosphere of latin america  " so far from god ,  and so close to the united states "  .  the tremendous debt that erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of latin america's international debt burden ,  although there many layers of meaning .   if you can appreciate a slow-moving ,  richly-textured movie ,  this one is for you . 
 " erendira "  is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about .  the film only exists in a low quality vhs format .  it's a shame this film hasn't been given a dvd release .   " erendira "  is stunning and gorgeous with its magic-realist images .   " erendira "  is based on a short story from the novel  " 100 years of solitude "  .  erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma's house .  her evil grandma ,  played by irene papas ,  forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages .  the whole town gets a piece of erendira ,  so to speak .  although the subject matter sounds harsh ,  the film doesn't exploit sexuality .  it's done in a mature artistic manner .  the film also has some amazing costumes .  some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most ,  are the origami birds that morph into real birds ,  and a golden orange with a diamond in the center .  erendira is an amazing film ,  that even manages to throw in humor .  this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release .  as they'd say in espanol ,   " es muy muy bien  !  !  !  excellente ! 
although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism ,  it is in fact nothing of the sort .  it is a political and cultural allegory of mexico's post-columbian odyssey ,  as even a passing glance at mexico's history will attest .    in contrast to  " like water for chocolate ,  "   " erendira "  expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work .   ( a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain :  proud ,  aloof ,  sorrowful and ,  above all else ,  weighed-down-with-history .  )   the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the  " outcome "  of history  ( i . e .  the present )  is always obscure ,  since we are too close to it for honest evaluation .  refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director ,  given the ambitions of the film .    " erendira "  is gorgeous .  a big-screen experience would be ideal ,  if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening .  but if not ,  vhs is better than never seeing it at all . 
i liked this movie .  when the guy who was in on a bank heist of $40 million in gold dies ,  his cell mate is used as  " bait "  to lead them to the high-tech crazy killer partner  ( by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge )  .  it's an action ,  spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light .  it reminded me of enemy of the state .  well acted and good enough plot . 
read eric's review again .  he perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than i ever could .  i'm only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it .   i saw it many years ago on tv ,  the ifc i think .  it is such a unique film i hesitate to make comparisons .  it was filmed in northern mexico ,  somewhere in the relentless badlands of coahuila/zacatecas/san luis potosi .  this isn't the sedona-like durango , mexico  ( of the john wayne films )  but a truly stark and wild place .  i have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story .  like the location ,  this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone .  it is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film .   i hadn't actually forgotten this movie ,  it is indelible .  yet ,  over the years ,  i had forgotten of its existence .  i know nobody who has seen it ,  had never read of it ,  nor seen any reference to it .  erendira is such an unusual name ,  i'd even forgotten the title .  well ,  i'll be looking to buy a copy now .   **i have since the above posting become a huge fan of gabriel garcia marquez and so regret not having read him before .   relative to msmyth's comment below ;  the movie was filmed in mexico but the author is colombian and was not commenting on mexico or mexican history in any way ,  although marquez now lives in mexico for  " political "  reasons .  this story is universal .    i am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library .  liked the movie ?  you have to read the story and then everything else garcia marquz wrote .  and ,  by the way ,  the original location in the story was colombia . 
unfortunately ,  this movie never made it to dvd .  i saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983 ,  and then again when the vhs was released in 1992 .  when i recently saw a vhs copy at a flea market ,  i immediately bought it .  i was not disappointed .  first ,  the obvious :  claudia ohana is beautiful and a joy to behold .  but then ,  the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you .  the movie is about a lot of things .  it is about how the world bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt that they can never repay .  it is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards ,  mortgage ,  and car payment .  it is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we cannot really save .  it is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other .  it raises a lot of questions but does not give answers .  i think sometimes this is good .  for this reason ,  this is a film really worth saving and seeing . 
i first rented this film many years ago ,  and was completely enthralled by it .  just recently ,  feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that i've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime ,  i decided to give  " erendira "  another look .  and i'm glad i did ,  as i soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film .   the story is about a teenaged girl  ( erendira ,  played remarkably by claudia o'hana - in some respects she resembles winona ryder !  )  who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother ,  played downright hypnotically by irene papas ,  forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages .    the viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though ,  inspite of the basic premise ,  which deals with prostitution ,  is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content .  the story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother ,  and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which ,  by the way ,  is in the rough and tumble part of rural mexico .   the film is very atmospheric ,  arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality .  it sometimes borders on the bizarre ,  but not to the point of ,  say ,  a david lynch film .  it's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature ,  read the comments from previous viewers below .  .  .   often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion ,  quiet and melancholy ,  adding just the right musical accents to highlight the mexican setting .  the cinematography of the rural places ,  many of which are in the desert ,  is quite superb .   the film moves at a nice pace ,  neither too fast nor too slow ,  and after every scene i felt i had to rewind the tape and play it over again ,  just because it makes you want to do that .  for me anyway ,  it really is that compelling .   hopefully you will see the film in its spanish language version ,  with subtitles .  i studied spanish in high school as well as in college ,  and i was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue .  por ejemplo :   " el mundo no es tan grande como pensaba .  "   (  " the world's not as big as i thought "  - i . e .  ,  it's a small world .  )   this film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine ,  which ,  upon drinking ,  is immensely satisfying ,  however ,  you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one . 
this movie is such cheesy goodness .   a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school .  they start getting killed off ,  they know they are being stalked ,  so what do they do ?  one girl decides to take a bath ,  another decides to cheat on her husband  ( who is also there )  with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed  ( in an old abandoned school ?  )  and go at it .   and it comes through with the gore and the t&a .   and it's also interesting from a historical/sociological point of view .  where the usual 80's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves ,  or how adults view young people ,  or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective .  this is a brit film made to be an american slasher .  it's hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak  " american "  unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents .   if you like cheesy 80's slashers  ( like pieces )  then you will like this one . 
poor geeky marty  ( simon scuddamore )  gets horribly burned due to a cruel april fool's day stunt gone very wrong .  flash forward a decade and those involved  ( including caroline monroe ,  known to horror fans for her turns in maniac ,  faceless & the last horror film )  in the prank are psyched for the upcoming 10 year high school reunion not aware that a court jester-masked killer is hiding out in the  ( now closed down )  school and out for revenge .   chaulk this one up to being a guilty pleasure ,  i knew it's a bad film .  it has all the characteristics of one .  yet there's just something about it that makes me feel compelled to watch it from time to time  ( preferably with beer in hand )  .  i'm even willing to overlook the absolutely horrid ending  ( which ,  i do have to say ,  i hate )  i guess i like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and some pretty cool kills .   eye candy  ( for the men )  :  josephine scandi & donna yeager both get topless   eye candy  ( for the ladies )  :  a gratuitous cock shot of simon scuddamore at the start of the film   my grade :  b-   lionsgate dvd extras :  optional trivia track ;  trailer for this film ;  and trailers for my bloody valentine  ( 1981 )  ,  monster squad ,  dirty dancing
 " slaughter high "  is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty , who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters . the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned . five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion-just the ten of them of course , and low and behold marty murders them one after another . british actress caroline munro (  " maniac "  ) leads the cast as the heroine ( who dies anyway !  )  . the acting is completely awful , there's also no suspense at all . plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore-freaks : a guy's stomach explodes , another female victim literally gets an acid bath , a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted , a guy is crushed by a tractor , one girl is drowned , and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye . the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester's mask and the setting ( a beautiful old english castle ) is really nice . however the dream finale is utterly pathetic . all in all it's true that  " slaughter high "  is a piece of garbage , but i enjoyed it . only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks . 
a bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy marty  ( a sympathetic performance by simon scuddamore )  which leaves him hideously disfigured .  five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion .  of course ,  an angry and vindictive marty shows up dressed in a jester's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors .  writers/directors mark ezra ,  peter litten and george dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clichés which make these 80's slice'n'dice body count flicks so much cheesy fun :  fake jump scares ,  prowling steadican shots ,  a fierce storm ,  an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack ,  a nice smattering of gratuitous female nudity ,  a totally ridiculous  " what the hell ?  "  supernatural climax ,  tacky make-up f/x ,  and one of those lovably lame  " it was all just a terrible dream "  fake-out non-endings .  moreover ,  the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods :  gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer ,  a lady taking an acid bath ,  a guy being crushed under a huge tractor ,  and two people getting electrocuted while in the middle of having wild passionate sex .  thirtyish british cult horror siren caroline munro is hilariously miscast as an american teenager in the first third of the flick .  the cast all give solid performances ,  with especially stand-out work from carmine iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader skip pollack ,  billy hartman as faded macho meathead frank ,  and donna yeager as foul-mouthed slut stella .  co-producer dick randall has an amusing cameo as munro's sleazy agent manny .  harry manfredini's moody ,  rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his  " friday the 13th "  scores .  alan pudney's slick cinematography does the trick .  good ,  trashy fun . 
i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months .  i was actually surprised at how good it was .   the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty .  they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned .   a few years later ,  the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party .  though ,  not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party .   later through the film ,  the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible .  i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well .   at the end of the film ,  you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened .  but ,  marty is in the hospital with severe burns .  although the murders didn't happen ,  the burns and the pranks apparently did happen .   the acting is terrible but that is fine .   i love the story .  i really sympathize with marty .  it's like tamara  ( 2005 )  .  the bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge .   i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers .   i give this movie 8 stars out of 10 .  good cheesy slasher ! 
okay ,  sorry ,  but i loved this movie .  i just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies ,  because you don't see many like this one anymore !  i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off ,  or a cheesy imitation ,  what is it imitating ?  i've never seen another movie like this one ,  well ,  not horror anyway .   basically its about the popular group in school ,  who like to make everyones lives living hell ,  so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty .  it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks .   so ,  its like 10 years later ,  and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters .  but .  .  . they are the only ones receiving them !  so they return back to the old school ,  and one by one get knocked off by .  .  .  .  .  .  . yeah you probably know what happens !   the only part that disappointed me was the very end .  it could have been left off ,  or thought out better .   i think you should give it a try ,  and try not to be to critical !   ~*~cupidgrl~*~
my 10/10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked  " slaughter high "  even before watching it .  yes ,  it's the typical revenge-several-years-after-a-dirty-prank story ,  but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here ?  !  i couldn't have predicted that bathtub scene in a million years .   ok ,  so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new .  well ,  it doesn't pretend to .  it's the sort of flick that the characters in  " scream "  probably watched ,  and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie .  after all ,  who doesn't like to watch people suffer for doing these things ?  obviously ,  it's got sort of a reactionary undertone ,  as people get punished for doing what the '60s championed .  but still ,  you gotta love this stuff !  so ,  with apologies to don mclean ,  this jester didn't sing for the king and queen ! 
i have seen slaughter high several times over the years ,  and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor ,  but i never knew that it was filmed in the uk ,  and i never knew that the actor that plays marty rantzen  ( simon scuddamore )  committed suicide after the film was released .  i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for americans ,  and a few of them aren't very good at hiding their english accents .   all that aside though ,  this is the tale of the class nerd ,  marty ,  who is the butt of jokes from his classmates ,  and on one particular day ,  april fools day ,  he's lured into the girl's locker room by one caroline munro  ( yes ,  playing a teenager )  and humiliated big time on film .  of course ,  the coach catches the gang at work & they're all given a vigorous workout to punish them ,  but not before a couple of the guys slip marty a joint ,  which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab ,  but it's full of something that makes him sick & when he runs to the restroom ,  one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something marty is mixing ,  which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid ,  which leaves poor marty burned & horribly scarred .   ten years later ,  this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old doddsville high ,  which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible ,  but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict .  .  . except there's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course ,  they eat ,  drink ,  and be merry .  for soon ,  they will die ,  of course .   the gang is stalked one-by-one by a figure in a jester's mask ,  but could it be marty ?  they don't know ,  they figure he's either in a loony bin or working for ibm ,  they're not sure which .  but whoever it is ,  he's making quick work of them .  particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer .  she is victim to an acid bath which i believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version ,  because it seemed extra nasty when i watched it this time .  i could be wrong but i believe that wasn't on the tape .   at any rate ,  there's somewhat of a twist ending ,  and that also contains footage not on the tape ,  i believe .  there's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised ,  but apart from that i didn't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version ,  probably so but it's been a while since i've last seen it .   at any rate ,  if you're a fan of 80's slasher flicks then snap up the new release dvd ,  because it's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere & feel to it .  7 out of 10 . 
both my friend and i thought this movie was well done .  we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts .  we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy .  i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job .  most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid .  we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie .  if you don't buy rent it for a good time . 
it's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school .  if you liked this movie ,  then i would suggest you watch valentine .  i just found out today that the guy who played marty ( simon )  killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job .  i wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie .  it starts out when carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it .  when he was changing in the showers ,  carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready ,  camera ,  electric shock ,  pole .  when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked .  he tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it ,  grab marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling .  they picked him up ,  dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed ,  and they electricuted him ( slightly )  .  when the kids are in detention ,  given by the coach ,  2 of the boys give marty a joint that will make him throw up .  skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him .  while marty is puking in the bathroom skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was .  the lab blows up disfiguring him badly .  5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded .  one by one the people get killed off .  i don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned .  she could have gotten back up after marty left .  she almost got out the first time . 
this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre ,  which is my favorite genre of them all ,  so when i saw it was free on demand ,  i had to watch it !  it stars caroline munro ,  from both dr .  phibes films  ( she was his wife that died !  )  ,  dracula a . d .  1972 ,  the golden voyage of sinbad ,  captain kronos - vampire hunter ,  the spy who loved me ,  maniac ,  and faceless .   brought to you by the people behind don't open til christmas and pieces ,  heres my thoughts on this .  .  .   it opens on april fools day ,  where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower ,  and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet  ( all while hes naked !  )  .  the coach puts a stop to it ,  but both parties swear revenge .  but ,  the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive .   cut to the future ,  and its th high school reunion ,  or so they think  ( bwahahha ?  )  .  the only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid ,  and its april fools day  ( or really ,  the day before april fools ,  but the fun starts at midnight )  ,  yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall .  then they finally break into the school and it starts storming .   inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them ,  each of their lockers and belongings ,  along with marty's  ( the nerds )  locker and yearbook .  they also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends his time saying  " oooh yesser !  yesser !  i don't want no trouble ,  sir !  "  and then is killed instantly .  pretty pointless character ,  but hes still my favorite .   the movie takes a page out of alien's book ,  in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see !  thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die ,  and they start freaking out ,  except for shirley ,  who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this .  of course ,  it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off  ( very cool ,  mind you )  the rest of the night goes as usual ,  sex ,  drugs ,  and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask .  .  whats their plan ?   " all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon .  marty wont kill us during mid-day !  "  .  seriously ,  thats what he said .  apparently you can only kill at nighttime .  but will they survive through the night ?  who will live and who will die ?  and why are all the bodies disappearing ?  rent ,  buy ,  or steal this great movie to find out !  the movie is actually very good ,  filled with clichés  ( car wont start ,  dammit !  )  and just plain slasher fun .  not to mention they all have names like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan .  i recommend it to all of you !  and ,  not to mention ,  it has a spin off !  1989's cutting class is a spin-off from this slasher gem ,  and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowell .   favorite scene :  2 people having sex ,  the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't .   " talk dirty to me ,  frank !  !  "  she screams  " uh .  .  .  tits !  "   " dirtier !  "   " uh .  .  .  tits .  f*ck .  tits .  boobs .  f*ck .  "  .  it seems to work for her and at her climax ,  the killer electrocutes them both ! 
slaughter high starts like any other day at doddsville county high school where little minx carol manning  ( caroline munro )  has tricked resident nerd marty rantzen  ( simon scuddamore )  into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower ,  while doing so carol's gang of friends come in & give the now naked marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an april fool's day joke .  the school's sports coach  ( marc smith )  saves marty & punishes the gang who rather harshly blame marty ,  they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand & marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face .  years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school ,  they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there .  they all venture inside where they quickly learn they aren't the only ones there as marty is back & has revenge on his mind .  .  .   originally shot under the title april fool's day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named april fool's day  ( 1986 )  made the same year this american english co-production is unusual in that it has three credited writers & directors ,  george dugdale ,  mark ezra & peter litten  ( after never seeing a film with three credited director's i've now seen two in a week the other being the jean-claude van damme flick kickboxer  ( 1989 )  )  & i have to say i really rather liked slaughter high even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation .  one of the things i like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick ,  it doesn't try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules ,  short comings & trappings & plays up to them .  basically it delivers what it promises ,  a homicidal killer ,  blood ,  boobs & babes .  i thought the character's were alright ,  the story was ok even though it's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time & i actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which slaughter high gets a lot of flak for .  the first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another .  some of the situations & character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who's complaining ?   despite three credited director's slaughter high turned out pretty good ,  i liked the look of the film a lot .  the isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good ,  the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well & there's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow carol through various corridors of the rundown school .  while not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough & is professionally made .  there is some good gore here including burnt bodies ,  people melted with acid ,  impalings ,  stomach explosions ,  axes in faces & death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain !  the special effects are also better than one would expect & i was both impressed & pleased with the higher than expected body count .   technically the film is better than i had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today ,  i would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though .  supposedly set in america this was very obviously shot in england .  harry manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores & is basically the same as the theme from friday the 13th  ( 1980 )  & it's sequels .  anyone living here in the uk will probably recognise billy hartman who played frank as a regular in emmerdale farm  ( one of our nations top rated soap operas )  in which he plays terry woods !  while most horror fans will recognise the sexy caroline munro in a rare staring role .  legendary exploitation producer dick randall did the deed on slaughter high & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer .  .  .  talk about typecasting !  you can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was pieces  ( 1982 )  which he also produced behind him in his office .   slaughter high is a slasher film that i liked a lot ,  did you see that ?  i didn't say it was great i actually said i liked it on a personal level & i'm sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off so i can't recommend it but i can say i liked it ,  make of that what you want .  make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out .  if your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then slaughter high won't change your mind but if your looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this . 
wow ,  praise imdb and google ,  for i have been trying to remember the name of this f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years now .  slaughter high ,  man !  hells yeah !   i'm not going to bore you with a plot summary ,  and actors ,  and yadda yadda yadda ,  'cause you all know what's up .  that's why you're here anyway .  what i will do ,  however ,  is explain the fond memory i have of this quintessential 80's d-movie slasher joint .   in 1987 ,  when i was around the age of 7 ,  my father used to rent all these horror movies .  would he care that his kids were watching them with him ?  no .  so ,  at that young age i saw slaughter high .  what i saw in that movie stuck with me big time .  i haven't seen it since ,  but i remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie .  for example ,  the post-sex scene  ( why is there a metal bed in a school ?  )  gets electrocuted .  or ,  the guy being drowned in a cess pool .  come on !  my personal favorite ,  though .  .  . the exploding stomach from the tainted beer .  amazing !  how can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school ,  like ,  10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it ?  then his stomach explodes ?  what !  ?  and that great line :  let's take my car .  .  . it always starts .  classic crap all the way .    i mean ,  i look back now ,  almost 20 years later ,  and laugh at it .  but when i was 7 ,  i was scared sh ! tless .  that jester hat  ( or was it a mask ?  )  that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f*ck out !   all in all ,  yes ,  a crappy movie .  but for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me .  either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same late late late movie show ,  or hunt down a vhs copy and dust off your vcr . 
slaughter high is about a boy named marty .  he was harassed ,  and picked on in high school .  a group of kids played several pranks on him ,  and these pranks were really bad .  the last prank ended tragically .   cue to 5 years later .  the gang of kids meet up again for a reunion .  one of them set it up at the old high school .  the school is now abandoned ,  and they have to break in .  for some reason ,  the janitor is still there ,  but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer .   they start partying  , and looking at their old lockers ,  and they see something of marty's .  one girl feels sorry for marty but another guy calms her down .   once the kills begin ,  it is great .  every kills is creative and gory .  we see a figure in a jester mask ,  hunting them one by one throughout the school .  it appears marty is back to exact revenge .  after the first person is killed ,  they find out they are locked in the school .  they begin looking for a way out .   now ,  there are a number of illogical things in this movie .  first of all ,  i don't know anyone who has a 5 year reunion .  second of all ,  after the first kid dies ,  a girl gets blood all over her .  they all run away in a panic ,  yet she runs to the bathroom ,  and finds a bathtub .  hrr friend has just been killed ,  and she decides to take a bath !  ?  more importantly ,  why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom .  anyways ,  the bathtub doesn't seem to really work .  .  .  . and she dies a horrible death this is an 80s movie .  it is a horror slasher .  who cares if it has some illogical parts .  i for one don't .  this movie has really great deaths .  the ending .  .  .  .  there is a twist .  having recently seen haute tension ,  i can compare the two .  the only way they are similar is that there is a twist ,  which kind of left me disappointed .  .  .  .  . then right after the twist ,  comes a great ,  if not the best kill ,  in the movie .   after the last kill ,  the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy ,  and it was the perfect way to end the movie .  it has me going  " wow .  .  .  " 
i have lost count of how many reviews i've written on slaughter high .  i've read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie .  simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide ,  and even though this was his only film ,  he is what made the movie so great .  at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide .  then i found out due to the current webpage at www . imdb . com he was born in 1957 ,  in dayton ,  ohio .  simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man ,  but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses .  he did a good acting job ,  who can disagree ?  i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie .  must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least .  i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade .  i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered ,  and that high schools do not have bath tubs !  i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent ,  and unfortunately for simon's death he made no future films .  the reason ( s )  for his suicide are a mystery ,  and hopefully will be discovered in the near future .  doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high .  he looked like a teenager .  i give this film two thumbs up ,  the best horror film made .  probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business .  -jacob young
yes ,  the plot is hardly plausible and very thin .  yes ,  the acting does range from average to laughable .  yes ,  it has been done so many times before .  however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is .  there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie .  in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing .  i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be ;  a scary ,  funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none . 
 " slaughter high "  is ,  perhaps ,  the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s .  it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout .  that being said ,  it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula :  a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown .   the reason why  " slaughter high "  stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over-the-top .  marty ,  the killer ,  has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates .  they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower ,  jabbed at his crotch with a javelin ,  and ,  to top it off ,  rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him .   so ,  the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get .  when they reunite years later -- at a high school reunion put on by marty himself -- you realize they haven't matured all that much .  they're a bunch of sociopaths .   it is mind-boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion ,  which ,  by the way ,  is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair .  and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers -- as well as marty's -- on display ?  there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film .  the ending makes little or no sense .  and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fool's day works :  the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon .   in all ,  the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre ,  despite all of its flaws .  it is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to dvd ,  when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions . 
god bless 80's slasher films .  this is a fun ,  fun movie .  this is what slasher films are all about .  now i'm not saying horror movies ,  just slasher films .  it goes like this :  a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders ,  and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong .  disfigured and back for revenge ,  sporting a joker/jester mask  ( pretty creepy looking ,  might i add )  ,  marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later ,  after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion .  that is basically the plot ?  what's wrong with that ?  that's the beauty of 80's slasher films ,  most of them i would say .  a lot of things could be so ridiculous ,  but they keep drawing you more in an' in as they go by .  especially this film .   it features some outrageous killings ,  and some are quite creative as well .   ( poisoning of a beer can ,  acid bath ,  i can't remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either ) it really is a fun ,  fun movie .  that's all it is .  nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots ,  never mind their stupidity ,  and never mind the outrageous ,  random things that occur in this film .  such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer  ( when he's not even switching any buttons ,  you'll see )  and toilets being able to cough up blood ,  baths being able to have acid come out of them ,  just use that as part of your entertainment !  because thats what really makes it entertaining .   movies like this represent 80's slashers .  never again could movies like this get made ,  know why ?  it isn't the 80's anymore .  that is why you should just cherish them for what they are ,  good fun !  i highly recommend this film if you're a hardcore fan of slahsers such as friday the 13th .   one last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well ,  marty rantzen .  a disfigured ,  nerd ,  who kills all his old foes in a creepy jester mask .  a good villain makes a good slasher .  simon scuddamore ,  who played marty apparently committed suicide shortly after slaughter high was released .  that alone adds something creepy to the film ,  and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the marty character ,  i guess .  all in all ,  great 80's slashers fun !  it's a shame it will never be the same again .  .  . 
a serious comedy .  ross hunter-produced movie version of the french play  " les joies de la famille "   ( later americanized as  " a very rich woman "  )  is plush ,  well cast ,  occasionally funny .  .  . and unfortunately timeless .  a wealthy california widow ,  who appears to be frittering away her money ,  is railroaded by her two grown ,  greedy daughters ,  both of whom are afraid mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance .  the whole issue of a vital--but aged--woman sent to a rest home against her will ,  and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing ,  is touchy material for a comedy  ( and to his credit ,  director david lowell rich doesn't overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment )  .  some of the humor is a little broad and doesn't work ,  yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note .  sandra dee is also good as rosalind's granddaughter ,  and james farentino is very charming as a young lawyer .  the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly ,  and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time ,  that the seriousness of  " rosie !  " 's theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending .  the picture leaves you smiling--and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky .  *** from ****
i really liked this movie .  of course the idea is pretty much out there .  .  . the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding .  but alvin sanders ,  the man who the feds have  " volunteered "  to be implanted with the device ,  is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while .  alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem .  definetly worth a watch . 
as with most rosalind russell movies ,  this one is very entertaining -- it's fun all the way through .  it's definitely one of the last of this genre of film -- just good wholesome entertainment .  give it a try - i don't think you will be disappointed . 
rosalind russell executes a power-house performance as rosie lord ,  a very wealthy woman with greedy heirs .  with an auntie mame-type character ,  this actress can never go wrong .  her very-real terror at being in an insane assylum is a wonderful piece of acting .  everyone should watch this . 
absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch .  .  . i highly recommend this movie .  her performance ,  in my opinion ,  was academy award material !  the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format ,  whether it be tape or dvd .  they are ignoring a very good movie .  but universal has little regard for its library on dvd ,  which is sad .  if you get the chance to see this somewhere  ( not sure why it is rarely even run on cable )  ,  see it !  i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film ,  and too many  " reviewers "  spend hours writing about the story ,  which is available anywhere .   a 10 ! 
in addition to being an extremely fun movie ,  may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful .  this kind ,  fun loving woman had a great deal of money .  unfortunately ,  she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money .  this woman was lonely since the death of her husband .  he had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down .  to prevent that ,  she bought it .  her daughters were afraid she was throwing away  " their "  money and decided to take action .  the character actors in this film were a great plus also .  i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library ,  but as of yet ,  it's never been released .  sad . 
reviewed at the world premiere screening sept .  9 ,  2006 at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival  ( tiff )  .   this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste  ( recycled computers ,  keyboards ,  cables etc .  shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back )  and other desolation .   the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship .  still ,  what was there was interesting .  the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens ,  intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking .  the opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well .  scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang-je films at tiff  ( the feature still life/sanxia haoren & the documentary dong )  which were also built around that subject .   director jennifer baichwal ,  producer nick de pencier ,  cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q&a after the world premiere .  producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself . 
i had nowhere to go .  i was on a flight to vancouver .  i would probably have missed this film if i hadn't chosen air canada .  watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front ,  i found this captivating and mesmerising .  i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to it's end .  now i'm looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i'll be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door ,  is yet to be discovered !   the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills out' the story the photographs tell .   recommended  ( if you have time on your hands )  . 
edward burtynsky is a canadian photographer who makes art out of the least  " artful "  objects imaginable .  everyday items such as crates ,  boxes ,  metal containers ,  etc .  - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d'art by burtynsky's camera .  he achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them ,  that is .  even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through burtynsky's lens  ( but didn't we already know that from  " wall-e "  ?  )  .  he is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures  ( i . e .  the workers in those places )  ,  with their uniform clothing and robotic movements ,  become part of the industrial landscape .    " manufactured landscapes ,  "  a documentary about burtynsky's work ,  has much of the feel of a  " koyaanisqatsi "  about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns .  indeed ,  director jennifer baichwal and cinematographer peter mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms ,  as their own camera records burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in china ,  a dockyard in bangladesh ,  and the construction site at the massive three rivers gorge dam project in china .  with their fluid camera-work ,  the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of burtynsky's images .  in fact ,  the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows .   the movie does less well when burtynsky gets around to articulating the  " themes "  of his work ,  which ,  quite frankly ,  come out sounding confused ,  contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best .  but it is as a purely aesthetic experience ,  highlighting image and form ,  that  " manufactured landscapes "  resonates most .  in the case of burtynsky ,  perhaps ,  a picture really is worth a thousand words . 
this is the most confronting documentary i have ever seen .  it was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea .  based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of china ,  edward burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore .   taking no political sides ,  this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about - the by-products of economical growth ,  the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser-developed communities ,  the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles .   amazing ,  heart-breaking ,  impossible to ignore .  this is a challenging journey but one worth taking - please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues .  10/10 definitely ! 
i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie .  this movie was not intended to be a  " deep thought "  movie ,  which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be .  in fact ,  it would appear that if any movie doesn't produce a life altering insight ,  and a deep ,  twisted ,  mind boggling plot ,  they would rate it a 1 or 2 .  don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre ,  people .   this movie was an action/comedy flick ,  and that's all it was intended to be .  and for an action/comedy ,  it was very well done .  i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did ,  having never really been a jamie foxx fan ,  and having the over-used plot that it has .   the plot was nothing spectacular ,  using the typical criminal gets out of prison ,  and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act  ( see blue streak ,  hudson hawk ,  48 hours ,  etc .  etc .  etc .  )  but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist .  now the  " bad guys "  are actually the  " good guys "  and the real  " bad guy "  is an uber-geek .   jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous ,  while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character ,  and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film .   if you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in  " the matrix "  or a drama such as  " of mice and men "  then this movie isn't for you .  but if you enjoy the raw action ,  excellent fast-paced filming ,  and an occasional twist of humor tossed in ,  this movie won't disappoint you .  i would normally have rated it about an 8  ( on the same level as the die hard trilogy )  ,  but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be .   
i had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty in man's deconstructing the natural landscape .  it certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations ,  setup shots ,  and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide .  put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show .   this film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river .  each sequence stands on its own ,  but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability .  there are few words ,  this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way .  an awful ,  massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories .  individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our e-waste .  the birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards .  the construction of the three gorges dam ,  the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time .  the time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was .   the most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control .  the shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees ,  demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters .   the obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy save the earth documentaries .  the artist edward burtynsky explains the method wonderfully .  'by not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep .  it is not a simple right or wrong .  it needs a whole new way of thinking' .  the subtlety of this descends into an either/or proposition ,  but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side .   though never stated directly in any way ,  as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate ,  there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed .  the progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in .  what he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise .  unlike most films with environmental themes ,  this one ends with no call to arms .  it argues basically what's the point ,  but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally . 
mesmerizing ,  breathtaking and horrifying ,  this hauntingly beautiful film is the  " apocalypse now "  without fiction .  slow in pace ,  quiet in mood ,  it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom .   there is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease .  greed ,  the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress ,  has turned us into something like cancer ,  on its way to consume the host and die with it .  .  .   manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again . 
this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man .  it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things ,  parts of high-tech equipment presumably ;  it isn't really made very clear .  the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they're herded around outside in little yellow jackets .  the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory ,  and talking with his crew as he does so .  this is a world of relentless industrialization .  it's a relief at least to know these soulless images aren't going to be presented without a human voice ,  as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalter's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry ,  'our daily bread . ' 'manufactured landscapes' contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town  ( many towns ,  really )  being wiped out by the biggest dam ever ,  with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is .  some of these scenes ,  the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places ,  might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer sebastião salgado .  but this photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close .  his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold ,  neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltz .   all this happens in china ,  of course ,  though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh .  it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive .  there are a good many stills of the photographer's work--or were some of them made by the film crew ?  it isn't made clear .   edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer .  we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow .  the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted ,  and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring .  he admits himself that he takes no political stand .  when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film's cinematographer peter mettler ,  burtynsky's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification ,  and hence falsification .  but he is showing us places that ,  if we look closely ,  reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be .   logically ,  but not entirely fortunately ,  it is burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites .  burtynsky's  " epiphanies "  may have inspired his decades of fine work ,  but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we're changing the planet irreparably ;  are dependent on oil ,  which will run out ;  that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late ,  and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel .  the interest of 'manufactured landscapes' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it .  the reasons for watching it are two :  to see glimpses of burtynsky's work and the raw materials ,  the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully ;  and to observe scenes from the vast ,  awesome ,  daunting ,  and rather horrifying industrialization of modern china .   because of the limitations of the narration ,  the idea of the title 'manufactured landscapes' feels insufficiently developed .  it even seems a misnomer .  new landscapes they are ,  but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than  " manufactured .  "  'landscapes of waste' or 'wasted landscapes' might be better titles .  there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject ;  and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions . 
i have been an admirer of edward burtynsky's work for years ,  and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work ,  thanks to jennifer baichwal's documentary .  the severe beauty of the ship-breaking yard in bangladesh ,  the stone quarry in vermont ,  the enormous assembly plant in china ,  the beleaguered old neighbourhoods in shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down :  these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker .   at times i thought of old tv documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic-mold factories ;  the sort of stuff i grew up watching .  burtynsky's work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only shifted to asia ,  it has not stopped .  the strangest scene for me was the computer scrap-yard somewhere in china--the waste had a threatening air about it ,  while the workers were very jovial . 
this is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like  " the corporation "  and  " fahrenheit 9/11 .  "  its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature .  the film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed - while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress .    truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children .  bravo !   nb - this is also the only film  ( of 8 )  at varsity theaters  ( toronto )  boasting a stick-on tag which reads .  .  .   " to arrange group viewings please contact .  .  .  .  "   .  .  .  a further testament to the popularity and importance of this gem .   my bet .  .  .  an academy award nomination for best documentary .   ob101
i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie .  i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me .  before i start my review ,  let me first say this .  .  . it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner ,  yet the writers and scott chose a different approach .   plot :   simply stated ,  it's not boring .  most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people ,  often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit .  this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while .  just for reference ,  i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent ,  and i enjoyed them both tremendously ,  both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told .  they don't take any chances whatsoever ,  and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films .  domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking ,   " oh man ,  they're screwed now "  .  and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films .  it has a lot of depth to it ,  in my opinion ,  and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it .  overall ,  this is what kept me so interested in the movie .   characters :   i felt that the characters were accurate .  knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman ,  who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was .  it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that .   choco was also very believable ,  his use of spanish in inappropriate situations ,  his reactions to domino's lack of affection ,  as well as his jealousy issues within the team .  .  . they all rang true to me ,  which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic .   rourke's character was the least interesting to me ,  but it still rang true to me .  he seemed like an ordinary guy ,  trying to make ends meet .  i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it .  he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes ,  yet is still trying to live .   claremont/ladies :  i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story .  they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley ,  these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal .  you could empathize with them because ,  to them ,  this child's illness was a problem with no other solution .  these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help .   the mobsters :  they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can .  and i really liked that part .  they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting .   christopher walken/90210 guys :   they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie .  from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens .  their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable .   cinematography .  .  .  . yes .  .  .  . the cinematography .  this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans .  but in my opinion i thought it was genius ,  the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion .  i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement ,  just like anything else .  i both applaud and congratulate scott ,  the editor ,  the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie .  not only did they go far and above with its presentation ,  they went that much further .  the use of colors ,  both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob ,  bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else .  if you notice ,  in times of less stress or conflict ,  there were very few camera tricks if any at all .  this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it .  i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach .  hollywood films have grown predictable and bland .  most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns .  and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different .   granted ,  this movie isn't for everyone ,  but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point .  i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it .  i would recommend this to all ,  but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few .  i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie ,  but i think many people will .  we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co .  took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique .  and with that in mind ,  i think he succeeded tremendously . 
ah ,  domino is actually a breath of fresh air ,  something new to the cinema world .  i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot ,  the varied characters ,  and the intense camera effects .  i've seen some complain about the camera work and ,  in fact ,  according to the creators themselves ,  the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time .  all of what you see was the desired effect .  perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before ,  although that's what sets it apart .  in a deeper aspect ,  what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes ,  think about it .   when it comes to the story ,  i don't see anything quite bad about it .  despite it's  " messy "  nature ,  according to some ,  it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling .  the plot really isn't all that hard to follow ,  if you actually focus on what's going on .  maybe it's just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting ,  the plot ,  etc .  i'm no  " interpreter "  or anything who picks movies apart ,  it just comes to me .  with that said ,  i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed ,  despite it's future as a cult-classic ,  blockbuster ,  or whatever .   and the characters ,  well there's no doubting how varied the cast is .  i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively ,  that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen .  the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives ,  setting them apart even further .  basically ,  i personally loved the cast and characters .   all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don't see it as i do ,  or it just doesn't appeal to them .  no matter ,  this is a great film in it's own right ,  no ,  it's a great film period . 
when i rented domino i was expected it to be very dumb .  i hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and domino also just got very bad reviews .  the only reason i watched it is because i like have liked keira knightley ,  mickey rourke ,  christopher walken ,  and tony scott on other occasions .  i also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories .  yes the editing and cinematography were frantic ,  the story was weak ,  and the acting was mediocre ,  but i still loved this film for some bizarre reason .  domino was very ,  very entertaining and often very funny .  it was horribly underrated when it was released i think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like scotts last film man on fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment .  i actually understand why everybody hated domino so much ,  even though i loved it and recommend it . 
kiera nightly moved straight from the p&p set to this action movie .  .  .  she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically .  a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen's classic ,  she is ,  once again ,   " having a go "  .  just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle ,  it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life .  .  .  but then this is exactly what domino harvey  ( the real one )  did ,  and i  ( being one of nightly's biggest fans )  believe she carries if off .   stuff .  .  .  .   * 90210  ( for the non american world )  is the post code of beverly hills in la ,  where all the film stars live .  * domino harvey father's mostfamous film was manchurian candidate  ( which appears in the film )  .  * domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june 2005 ,  after having been arrested for drug dealing .  she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film .  * kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey's sexuality in her interview with lucy liu .   if you find this film a bit far fetched ,  then check out domino harvey ,  as the facts are more amazing than the fiction . 
domino is a great movie .  it's about a young woman names domino harvey  ( kiera knightley )  who becomes a bounty-hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle .  she joins with two fellow hunters  ( mickey rourke & edgar ramirez )  and the adventures begin .  the script is good .  very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film .  the only problem i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do ,  instead of the character of domino .   even with that ,  kiera knightley gives a fierce performance .  she shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance .  mickey rourke follows up his oscar-worthy performance in 'sin city' with another tough-guy performance .  edgar ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at kiera .  delroy lindoi gives a good supporting performance .  mo'nique was herself ,  although she did surprise me on one particular scene .  lucy liu has great chemistry with kiera knightley in her scenes with her .   the best thing about the movie though ,  is the direction .  tony scott's fast-paced style really brings the movie to life .  the cinematography is some of the best ,  i've ever seen .  it takes a regular movie and puts on acid .  all the blacks are blacker ,  the whites are brighter ,  and it has a sort of green glow to it .  the action scenes are exhilarating .   overall :  if you liked sin city & man on fire ,  you'll like domino . 
i had no expectations ;  i'd never heard of jamie foxx ;  all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it .  i thought it was highly entertaining ;  it was fun .  the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest .  to me ,  foxx is an original .  david morse is terrific  ( true ,  this is not his finest role )  .  i thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done .  i didn't expect a lot and i was happily surprised . 
as soon as i knew keira knighteley being in this flick ,  i said  " i have to watch this movie "  .  she's the undisputed main character ,  domino ,  a bounty hunter .  her  " job "  ,  as the  " no action "  scenes would teach us ,  reflects her rebel ,  violent attitude to life .  i have to admit that it's the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands .  so ,  this stomped me a bit .  anyway ,  for all the john woo's fans ,  there are helicopters falling down ,  explosions ,  gunfire as if it would rain ,  and a lovely keira that shoots with two machine guns ,  one per hand .  the cast is absolutely brilliant .  going beyond keira ,  which in this movie is a real tomboy ,  pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see ,  mickey rourke is back ,  with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body .  christopher walken makes his job pretty well ,  as a reality show producer .   let's go to the contents :  this movie has a journalistic shape .  the talk show scene is  " disgustingly "  real .  anyone that watched that load of  .   .   .  you-know-what ,  can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations .  as well as the producer ,  when domino's mom says that the reality that should show domino's life is  " trash ;  no offense "  ,  he answers  " i don't take it like an offense "  .  this movie portrays a difficult life .  domino ,  coming from a world that didn't want her ,  ed  ( mickey rourke )  ,  a bounty hunter  " not so bounty "  ,  choco  ( the third guy of the band )  ,  which family is  ( using ed's words )  ,   " the correctional institutes he's been "  ,  and alf ,  the driver/bomber coming from afghanistan during the russian occupation .  this bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born  " without the shirt "  ;  unlucky ,  violent ,  and with nothing to lose ,  excepts their  ( as they would consider )  miserable lives .  the intro of the movie says that it is  " inspired by true story  .   .   .  more or less "  ,  so i couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true .  anyway ,  going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons  ( which could have been  " added "  to make the film easier to see ,  and be classified as an action movie )  ,  the characters' story is too realistic to be  " edulcorated "  .    the interaction between the characters is various ,  well studied ,  and definitely not boring .  what hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist  ( lucy liu ,  sober as never in her acting career )  .  it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story  ( and that's a story )  .  probably ,  the only  " con "  ,  in a movie with a lot of  " pros "  .    all in all :  this isn't  " swat "  .  the characters are crafted ;  they have an identity ,  a shape .  they have a name and a surname  ( not just  " gamble "  and  " street "  )  .  it's the case to say ,  it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet . 
i doubt much of this film is based on a true story .  at the beginning it says based on a true story ,  sort of .  i bet the only truth to it was there was an ex-model turned bounty hunter possibly named domino .   anyways ,  it begins with domino talking to lucy liu ,  who works for the fbi .  domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars .  through flashbacks ,  we see domino as a child ,  then as a model ,  and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter .  she basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off ,  ed and choco .  they let her join the group .  she's tough ,  can use any kind of weapon ,  and will use her good looks if needed .   they get involved with a scam that clarmont ,  a bailsman ,  has going .  along the way ,  the group starts a reality tv show ,  and that's where ian zering and brian austin green become involved .  they are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this .   i thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs .  the editing didn't bother me .  there's also a lot of violence ,  mainly using guns ,  and blood .  it could have been a little shorter .   final verdict :  good enough to watch . 
i'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum ,  and many of the reviews .  i think tony scott made a good movie here .  yes ,  it is highly stylized ,  flashy and over the top ,  but it is very entertaining .  i'm glad at least ebert and roeper agrees with me  :  )    this movie may not be for anyone ,  but if you like over-the-top ,  dark humor ,  cool action and dialog ,  you should see it .    i've previously seen scott's man on fire ,  crimson tide and enemy of the state - all good movies ,  but i like this one more .  it's like a roller-coaster ride ,  with great soundtrack selections ,  visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 ,  it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity ,  gory violence ,  and have explicit dialog .   it doesn't hurt that keira is super-hot ,  and even shows nipples in this one ,  either .  .  . 
i rented domino on a whim ,  not even knowing it was inspired by a true story ,  and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see .  i found it to be rather awesome .   with richard kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment .  and once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it .    domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career .  it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott .  and with fast paced music and editing ,  it provides the visual flare to keep your attention ,  with slick performances and unexpected comedy ,  the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience .    i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours . 
if you go to this movie expecting something it isn't ,  you will be disappointed ,  as with any movie .  this movie contains what hemmingway described as the  " iceberg effect "  .  on the surface ,  its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie .  if this would be written in a book ,  it would be a short story ,  because the action in the movie is very fast paced ,  and unless you actually try to catch it ,  the reasoning behind the plot  ( along with some subtle foreshadowing )  can very well pass you by .  definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate .  experimental cinematography barely describes this movie .  the camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film ,  making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others  ( something to be desired in american movies as of late )  .  although ,  at some parts it may get a little raunchy ,  gruesome and too heavy for some audiences ,  the movie never becomes completely unrealistic .  the only aspect of the movie that i would write off as  " needs improvement "  is the soundtrack selection .  no movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack ,  and although the soundtrack is quite fitting ,  the opening is a little too long ,  and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate  ( heavy ,  grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip )  .  the flooding of imagery and dynamic .  .  .  color palettes adds another  " artistic "  aspect to it ,  also combined with the events that happen throughout the film ,  this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand .  however ,  that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch ,  and not one you'll quickly get bored of .  8 . 5/10
if you find yourself in need of an escape ,  something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world ,  domino will satisfy that need .  this is entertainment ,  after all !  the plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies  ( like usual suspects )  where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out .  i wondered about domino harvey herself ,  how her life became of interest to hollywood .  as for the acting ,  lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers .  and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well .  not once did i think of kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume .  and granted ,  mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and often ,  but here ,  despite the violence ,  he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people . 
 "  domino  "  has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and  "  sickening  "  photography .  it's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of  "  style over substance "  i couldn't disagree more .  i believe that  "  domino  "  represents the absolute height of tony scott's film-making career .    after having created the dominant hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties tony scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema .  as early as  " crimson tide "  scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched-angle framing .  this was then carried through to  "  enemy of the state "  and  " spy game "  which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively .     "  man on fire "  was an extreme departure  ,  a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic .  here scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage  .  although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in  "  domino "   couched in the framing device of an fbi interrogation  "  domino "  presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory .  she grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments ,  flashes and brief snatches .  as domino relays her story verbally scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them .  she does have  "  traces of mescaline "  in her system but her individual vision is anyway unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting .    it is when domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that scott really lets rip .  together with cinematographer dan mindel and composer harry-gregson williams scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary americana .  gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be domino is no more disjointed than the  " 90210 "  culture she has rejected .  as she wades through this cultural melange scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces .  ultimately scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip .    to criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a picasso or a pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human .  like any great painting the meaning in  "  domino "  is in the surface and the surface is everything .    i am not in any way associated with scott free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of tony scott's work
my name is domino harvery .  {edit *dizzying* chop} my--my--my name is domino harvey .  {cut ,  chop} my name is domino harvey .  {edit .  cut .  playback}  never have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before .  by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scott's choppy ,  flashy ,  dizzying editing technique .  if i have to choose between loving it and hating it ,  i'd say i love it .  it was borderline distracting at times ,  but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality  ( even if it borrows heavily from mtv videos )  .   this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy .  otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her ,  no matter how much she suffered .  we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke ,  rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez .  the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walken's tv production company  ( what is christopher walken doing in every film ,  by the way ?  )  .  i guess that is a clever film technique ,  because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtv/reality show editing footage as he likes .  it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this point .   it followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace ,  with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence .  there are some funny jokes ;  it's all very modern and surreal at the same time .  it's a mess ,  but it's a rather enjoyable mess .  it is ultimately flawed in so many ways  ( the actors try too hard to make their characters  " cool "  ,  for one )  but it works .  i give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film  but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well .   7 out of 10
this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid .  the swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summers ago when i had just finished my first semester of medical school .  i was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained .  sure ,  some things are simplified but most of it was correct  ( even though it was made 22 years ago !  )  and quite understandable .  i would suggest that all soon-to-be medical student should watch it .  it is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example .  now i'm in my 7th semester and i think i'll watch the series once again as soon as i've bought the dvd-box  : - ) 
this tv-series was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid .  even though i see it now through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia ,  i can still tell it was a quality show ,  very educational but still funny .  i have not seen the original french version ,  only the swedish .  i have no idea how good the dubbing was ,  it was too long ago to remember .   the premise of the show was to show you how the body works .  i swear ,  school still hasn't taught me half of what i know from this show .  it also tied in other things ,  like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don't exercise ,  with nice examples within the body .  who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you ?   : d the cartoon looked nice ,  very kids friendly of course ,  but done with care .  cells ,  viruses ,  electric signals in the brain ,  antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures ,  looking pretty much how you'd expect what they should look like in the animated body .   this ,  and the series about history ( especially the environmentally scary finale )  were key parts of my childhood .  i'm so happy i found them here . 
we bought the dvd set of  " es war einmal das leben "   ( german )  /  " once upon a time .  .  .  life "   ( english )  for our bilingual kids because everyone loved the  " es war einmal der mensch "   ( german )  /  " once upon a time .  .  .  man "   ( english )  series  ( us parents had seen it as kids )  and it has exceeded even high expectations !  the series is very well made ,  does not show its age ,  and our kids at various ages really like to watch it .  at the same time ,  they learn things us parents didn't know until way ,  way later .  the series covers everything to do with the human body from organs ,  all senses ,  blood ,  infection ,  antibodies ,  and much more in animated 20-25 min episodes .  topics some people may find  " sensible "  ,  such as digestion and reproduction are covered in a tasteful ,  discreet and child-friendly manner  ( the reproduction episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing )  ,  while still  ( as typical )  informative and fun .   children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment .  the format of the episodes switches between the outside world  ( a family with 2 children )  and the inside of the body .  for example ,  in the episode covering infections ,  the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this .  similarly ,  the episodes on the senses ,  e . g .  hearing ,  seeing ,  link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete lifecycle including  ( briefly )  where the oxygen comes from  ( plants )  .   this is one of the best ever children's programs - i would say it's a must see for every family with kids ! 
actually this movie was not so bad .  it contains action ,  comedy and excitement .  there are good actors in this film ,  for instance doug hutchison  ( percy from  " the green mile "  )  ,  who plays bristol .  another well known actor is jamie kennedy ,  from  " scream "  and  " three kings "  .  the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin ,  who was pretty good and also funny ,  but the one who most surprised me ,  was david morse as edgar clenteen .  he plays a different character than he usually does ,  because in other films like  " the green mile "  ,   " indian runner "  ,   " the negotiator "  or  " the langoliers "  he plays a very sympathetic person ,  and in  " bait "  the plays almost the opposite ,  a man without any emotions ,  which was nice to see .  the only really negative thing about this film ,  are the several pictures of the world trade center ,  which makes this film perhaps look a little dated .  overall i thought this was a pretty good little film ! 
this is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins ,  viruses ,  blood cells etc .  i will not try to explain it in more details ,  you will simply have to see it for yourself :  you will not be disappointed .   i remember watching this as a kid in the 80s  ( with swedish voices )  .  i have talked with a few people who were also children in the 80s and they loved it also !  i must admit that the education-part of the episodes didn't get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of educating children while they have fun is wonderful .  i have recently seen a few episodes ;  there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays .   5/5
this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works .  yes ,  this is biology but they will never tell it is .   i truly think this is the best part of this stream of  " educational cartoons "  .  i do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts :  skin ,  skeleton ,  and of course :  organs .    in the same stream ,  you'll find :   " il était une fois l'homme "  which relate the human history from the big bang to the 20th century .  there is :   " il était une fois l'espace "  as well  ( about the space and its exploration )  but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future . 
you know the story - a group of plucky no-hopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning - it's a tale that has been done to death by hollywood  ( bring it on ,  the karate kid ,  escape to victory ,  best of the best etc )  .  now korea gives it a go with a taekwondo team struggling for glory  and guess what  the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying .   the fact that this movie doesn't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters ,  and this in turn keeps you watching to the end .   fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most kung fu films ;  the action is limited to  ( albeit impressive )  kicking and the occasional punch .  this doesn't matter though ,  since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success . 
a good korean film about not just taekwondo but what its takes to be good ,  like a thugs way of fighting cannot beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules ,  just as there are to life and school and this film has undertones of this notion .   the martial arts in the film isn't that good but it is passable and enjoyable .  friends who go on to achieve something they once would mock become stronger through the mind and heart .  this film isn't meant to be taken too seriously as it does have slapstick ,  but it also carries a message .   a good film again from korea . 
the movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do .  the films props itself as a fun and entertaining time .  and that's exactly what it was .  it is the korean version of a male bring it on .   from the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a carbon copy of another .  instead ,  the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining  " thugs "  came to be men in their own right .  therefore ,  the film is fun and entertaining .   the camera work ,  specially the dolly moves were very well executed .  the script ,  being a tad weak ,  was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire .  this film will not win any oscars ,  nor any dvd blockbuster sales ,  but a fun watch and a fun experience . 
sure ,  the plot isn't oldboy .  it seems the only  " great "  movies these days are amazingly shocking or high-budget/hyped in some way .   spin kick is a drama/comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into tae kwon do .  regardless of what you expect from this film ,  you're guaranteed to feel moved by the work ,  pain ,  and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience .  though comedic at times ,  many moments and characters are rendered beautifully :  there's the old guard character who takes things too seriously ,  the hoodlum turned good-guy who just wants a second chance at life ,  the meek team-substitute who would die happy if he just won once in his life ,  and many other well-rounded characters with their own problems-- but most importantly ,  their own their hopes and dreams .  while the plot and the goals of the movie are simple ,  these aspects of the movie merely highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and inter-personal struggles .    in short ,  this film will leave you feeling fresh ,  determined ,  and satisfied . 
first things first !  this isn't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it !  i think you can compare it to american sports movies !  where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable , winning a game or tournament beyond expectation !  in this case it isn't about football or baseball , but taekwondo !  in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing !  but soon we will find out that they don't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life !  it is nice to see them struggle and training !  i was surprised how funny this movie was !  from start till the end you will laugh your pants off !  the young korean actors are very convincing !  go see this wonderful feel good movie ! 
dream quest was a surprisingly good movie .  there were some noticeable goofs ,  but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time .  i did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and i found it pretty entertaining .  it gets kind of silly at times ,  but overall i recommend it .  they probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores ,  and some of the costume designs were pretty good . 
dreamquest is by far ,  the best porn movie i've ever viewed .  this is a must see !  !  !  and if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it ,  just skip over the naughty scenes .  of course ,  this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes .  but even then it's enjoyable .  this movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie .  .  . even shawshank redemption . 
i watched this movie once and might watch it again ,  but although jamie foxx is good in the movie ,  i feel they could have used a 'less funny' character as alvin sanders .  foxx's scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen  ( david morse )  are too funny .  david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop .  his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role .  once again morse meets doug hutchinson  ( bristol )  in the theater .  morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson .  they are both perfect for this scenario in each film .  i personally love that quality in a film ,  where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film ,  as these two did in the green mile .  overall it was a pretty good movie . 
oh yeah !  jenna jameson did it again !  yeah baby !  this movie rocks .  it was one of the 1st movies i saw of her .  and i have to say i feel in love with her ,  she was great in this move .   her performance was outstanding and what i liked the most was the scenery and the wardrobe it was amazing you can tell that they put a lot into the movie the girls cloth were amazing .   i hope this comment helps and u can buy the movie ,  the storyline is awesome is very unique and i'm sure u are going to like it .  jenna amazed us once more and no wonder the movie won so many awards .  her make-up and wardrobe is very very sexy and the girls on girls scene is amazing .  specially the one where she looks like an angel .  it's a must see and i hope u share my interests
this one is quite a nice surprise .  cute little story of the heroine's quest ,  very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy soon-to-be-spinster type into a raunchy dd-cup sex queen .    visually a sight for sore eyes ,  not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for  ( most of )  the costumes and make-up of the actors .  an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation .   back to the positives :  the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera-shots which you would not expect in a soft core .  loved that scene with the icicles ,  absolute classics potential .  a slight minus only for  ( very )  few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief .    9/10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect . 
very nice action with an interwoven story which actually doesn't suck .  interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts .  having jenna jameson and asia carrere helps liven it up ,  too .  jenna in that sweater and those glasses is just astounding !  worth picking up just to see her ! 
if you've ever wondered why they don't make porn with a plot ,  watch dream quest .  on the one hand ,  you have to give the armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it .  on the other hand ,  it also quickly becomes apparent why most porns never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together .  these people simply cannot act  ( and the story is ,  unfortunately ,  lame to a ridiculous degree )  .   still ,  i gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners .  also ,  i'd like to see more attempts like this one .  maybe someday i will see the perfect combination of porn and plot . 
before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched .  as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed ,  i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed .  except asia carrera's sexual scene ,  any sexual scene in this movie doesn't make me feel great  ( you know what i mean )  .  the great jenna jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of .  felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned .   although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor ,  this movie is very good .  if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies .  story ,  acting ,  direction ,  sets ,  makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great .  the actors of this movie done really good acting ,  they all done a great job .  dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies . 
this is really films outside  ( not in a motel room )  .  with real costumes  ( not only strings and swimsuits )  .  you have to see this movie .  it's the only porn movie i know that is worth watching between the sex scenes .   bon cinema  laurent
this is a more interesting than usual porn movie ,  because it is a fantasy adventure . the production values are high and the acting is ( believe it or not )  pretty good , especially jenna jameson . it`s also in widescreen which helps , it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and not a porn movie . but , of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes , fine atmosphere and scenery . and by the way , the sex is hot .   watch out for this one .  .  . 
saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it .  i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community - grit ,  determination ,  exuberance ,  creativity ,  in your faceness with a dose of desperation .  the writing ,  dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process .  great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well .  all the characters are multi dimensional - none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong .  this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth ,  hip hop and communities like jane finch . 
beforehand notification :  i'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here ,  but when i saw the preview for this movie ,  i was thinking  " finally !  "  i have yet to see one movie about popular african-influenced dance  ( be it popular hip hop moves ,  breaking ,  or stepping )  where the main character was a black woman .  i've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it  ( breakin ,  breakin 2 ,  save the last dance ,  step up )  ,  but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent .  that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop ,  african-influenced dance ,  and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn't always men who performed it ,  so i felt this movie has been a long time coming .  however ,  the race does not make the film ,  so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot ;  the dancing be entertaining ;  and interesting to watch .   pros :  i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture .  i can't recall ever seeing a popular ,  mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican ;  had believable accents ;  and weren't stereotypical with the beanies .  the steppers ,  family ,  friends ,  and even the  " thugs "  were all really intelligent ,  realistic people who were trying to love ,  live ,  and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive .  even when the audience was made aware that the main character's sister chose an alternate lifestyle ,  it still didn't make the plot stereotypical .  i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed .  i loved the stepping ;  the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers ;  the trials that the main character's parents were going through ;  and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel .  i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time ,  and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world .  they were all just as excellent as the fellas .  i don't see that in too many movies nowadays ,  at least not those that would be considered black films .   cons :  i'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this ,  but i question whether they've been to real step shows .  whenever the steppers got ready to perform ,  some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers' hand/feet beats .  at a real step show ,  there is zero need for music ,  other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups .  and then when hip hop songs were played ,  sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers' hands and feet .  it was awkward .  i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus  " stomp the yard "   ( another great stepping movie )  because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys  ( in  " stomp the yard ,  "  meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the  ( deltas ?  )  let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately )  .  even when there were very small scenes ,  the ladies tore it up ,  especially in the auto shop ,  and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music .  i know soundtracks have to be sold ,  but the movie folks could've played the music in other parts of the film .   i'm not a keyshia cole fan ,  so every time i saw her ,  all i kept thinking was  " is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks ?  "  she looked uncomfortable on screen to me .  i thought they should've used a host like free or rocsi instead .  deray davis was funny as usual though .  also ,  i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto ,  like stepping couldn't possibly happen anywhere else .  hollywood ,  as usual .  however ,  only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers ,  which mainstream movies tend to do .   i would've given this movie five stars ,  but the music playing killed it for me .  i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs . 
this film is shockingly underrated on imdb .  like so many films ,  this isn't shawshank .  but it's a reasonably good ,  if predictable ,  dance competition / personal growth film .  if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer ,  than i think you'll like it .   judging from the imdb ratings ,  my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 ,  and was  " vote bombed "  with many 1s ,  as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob ,  don't have special effects ,  or include non-white or non-straight characters .   it's an american film ,  but it's not a us film .  set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle ,  and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit .   i liked the music .  i liked the dance  ( but not convinced it's worth $50 , 000  .  .  .  but what do i know )  .  the characters were easy on the eyes .   i do agree the title sucks .  i don't remember anyone in the film saying those words ,  and it should have an  " s "  .   ( no ,  it's not a foreign language )  .   there's not a lot to hate about this film  ( and let's be honest ,  a vote of 1 means you hated it )  so i can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it ,  and that's sad . 
i watch them all .   it's not better than the amazing ones  ( _strictly ballroom_ ,  _shall we dance ? _  ( japanese version )  ,  but it's completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts .   i am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting .  for example :  the  " name should scream don't watch .  'how she move . ' since when can movie titles ignore grammar ?  "    there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar .  it's just not canadian standard english grammar .  comments about the dialogue seem off to me .  i put on the subtitles because i'm a canadian standard english speaker ,  so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it .  it wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so american .   i loved that this movie was set in toronto and ,  in fact ,  wish it was even more clearly set there .  i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast .  i enjoyed the stepping routines .  i liked the driven mum character .  i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies .   in summary ,  if you tend to like dance movies ,  then this is a decent one .  if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking ,  your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie . 
well ,  if you are open-minded enough to have liked barber shop ,  then you will like this canadian film .   if your mind is as closed-minded as fort knox ,  then you will give it the current score that it has  :  2 . 5 .   this is a film for anybody prepared to watch films from outside of their own racial grounds .  it is engaging ,  it is true to life ,  on two or three occasions you lose the connections between the scenes ,  but many times ,  especially towards the end ,  you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often mirrors what life can be like .   i like it and recommend it to anyone open minded beyond the traditional american film . 
this movie surprised me .  some things were  " clicheish "  and some technological elements reminded me of the movie  " enemy of the state "  starring will smith .  but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo  ( providing some comic relief )  .  this is a movie you can watch over again-say .  .  .  some wednesday night when nothing else is on .  i gave it a 9 for entertainment value . 
i noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and i too didn't have high hopes for it .  i figured it was another  " you got served "  type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting .  i was at the theater and deciding between this and meet the spartans and picked this .  to my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good .  the fact that it has a lower rating than you got served is absolutely ridiculous .  instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a matinée showing of this movie so you don't spend too much .  i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it .  when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones .  go see the movie and judge for yourself .  hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released .   edit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating .  over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 ,  a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1 . 
i must give how she move a near-perfect rating because the content is truly great .  as a previous reviewer commented ,  i have no idea how this film has found itself in imdbs bottom 100 list !  that's absolutely ridiculous !  other films--particular those that share the dance theme--can't hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top-notch ,  believable acting ,  and amazing dance routines .   from start to finish the underlying story  ( this is not just about winning a competition )  is very easy to delve into ,  and surprisingly realistic .  none of the main characters in this are 2-dimensional by any means and ,  by the end of the film ,  it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them .   ( and ,  even if you're not the crying type ,  you might get a little weepy-eyed before the credits roll .  )    i definitely recommend this film to dance-lovers and ,  even more so ,  to those who can appreciate a poignant and well-acted storyline .  how she move isn't perfect of course  ( what film is ?  )  ,  but it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-baked plot and/or characters who lack substance .  the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers ! 
i was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates .  but living in italy titles like this never ever come across and i love step so much that i decided to give it try .  and how surprised i was !  the story is different from any other dance-movie i've seen lately ,  with a deeper meaning than just  " winning "  .  it's touching and well written and well directed .  raya is such a strong character ,  i love the fact that she never doubts herself ,  she's so mature and focused and aware of her talent  ( and what talent rutina wesley has ,  my jaw dropped in the final dance scene )  .  the way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is ,  honestly ,  inspiring .  also ,  the fact that she's not the typical super-hot chick  ( see jessica alba ,  briana evigan ,  jenna dewan ,  zoe seldana .  .  .  )  makes her really appealing and real .  seriously ,  why is this movie rated so low ?  you can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good work .  really good actually .  i even cried at the end of the movie .  and the dancing routines are just sick . 
i saw this movie when i was a little girl .  and i have enjoyed it every time .  sure the graphics are a little cheesy ,  compared to now ,  but back in the 70's it was great .  i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful .  that was how i remember my christmases were with my family - magical .  santa claus was amazing and i couldn't wait for him to come back each year .   if you have a child/children and speak spanish ,  bring them up watching this old fashioned version of  " santa claus "  .  it's a different version than we are used to today ,  but who says there is one way ?   it's a fun movie to watch .  it teaches children good vs .  bad .  i don't know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this ,  but the spanish is the best .  enjoy and happy holidays !  feliz navidad ! 
just get it .  the dvd is cheap and easy to come by ,  the length is now standard and you've gone long enough without it .   ( when home video started ,  there were at least three versions with parts missing .  .  )  everything you've read is true .  there is no defending it ,  and no living without it .  the color is lush and wonderful to look at ,  and the production values are pretty good for a saturday afternoon kiddie epic .  but no question .  . the whole santa vs .  satan angle is so jaw dropping strange it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult fave once home video really got underway .  how good/bad/strange/ is it ?  i only saw the trailer as a kid , and remembered it for nearly 30 years .  . including murray's over the top voice over .  . i told my older sister ,  and she called me a liar and could not believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where santa vs . satan .  .  add to it stuff like santa asking for the virgin mary's blessing before setting off on christmas eve ,  kids wanting to capture him and make him their slave .  . and an international kiddie sweat shop .  . and it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the 60's .  .  like others here ,  i watch the thing every holiday season now .   ( my version of choice is the mystery science theatre 3000 edition )  .  but any old way you choose it ,  the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must  ( along with brianiac ,  by the way .  .  )  . it never fails to make me laugh .  better ,  i think ,  then santa claus conquers the martians .  parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out .  ( how many parents do you know go out for cocktails on christmas eve ?   " if you get bored ,  just go downstairs and play the piano .  "  dang .  .  )  freaky ,  boring ,  disturbing ,  funny ,  childish ,  strange .  . hey ,  what more can you want ? 
perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing ,  albeit ,  completely corny ,  to adults .  not a bad film for a low-budget job .  children will be amazed with santa's workshop and the  " magic "  that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small ,  or homes that have no chimneys at all !   kids will thrill over the santa's success at thwarting the nasty devil named pitch  ( complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail !  )  .  they will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love .  and the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents .  and what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by pitch to help capture santa and ruin christmas ?  in the end ,  everyone ,  including the nasty boys ,  get just what they deserve for christmas !   the film will endear children to both santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world .   
i saw this movie when mystery science theater ran it in 1993 .  it is the worst thing i've ever seen .  so bad in fact ,  that by sheer freakiness ,  this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed .    whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten .  i mean ,  really ,  the devil vs .  santa ?  visions of hell ?  creepy laughing wind-up reindeer ?  forced child labor with racial stereotypes ?  it ain't sesame street ,  that's for sure . as crow exclaims during the mst3k showing ,   " this is good ol' fashioned nightmare fuel !  "    there's plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up theology .  merlin  ( presumably the arthurian merlin )  hangs out with santa in his crazy castle in the clouds  ( i . e .  heaven )  .  santa talks about baby jesus and sends letters to  " mr .  stork "  for children who ask for siblings .  there are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or raf stars .    my best friend and i have watch it every year since 1993 and we subject anybody we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us . 
there are some things i will never understand ;  why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example .  similarly ,  i will never understand this film ,  and that is brilliant .  if you approach this film expecting an actual movie ,  you might as well be approaching satan expecting a hug ;  although that may well be possible if you greet this film's satanic figures .  take pitch for instance ;  the most ineffectual ,  camp ,  unhellish portrayal of a devil since freddy mercury and wayne sleep joined forces to create a ten foot satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms .  however ,  it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever .  seriously ,  this is no understatement .  the same can be applied to every other character ,  bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent she's probably overcompensating for some serious crime she's part of .  then again ,  if santa's inter-space recon station is real ,  there is no chance she could have avoided him this long .  put simply ,  if you haven't seen this movie ,  you cannot consider yourself a serious buff .  the achingly funny characterisation ,  acting ,  concept ,  and almost-under-the-radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date  ( if you're after pure laughter that is )  . 
my mother took me to see this film as a child and i long to see it every year as i do all of my other christmas favorites .  what i remember most was the silly devil and santa looking through his telescope .  i waited and looked through the t . v .  guide each year after that to see when it would be shown .  i would usually find it playing on a saturday afternoon .  i only found the movie in english which took something special away from the film and have longed to find a copy of it in spanish .  i hold this film dear to my heart and have never suffered from nightmares as others might suggest .  yes ,  it is a different film about santa claus and that is what makes it special and unique .  i can't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as i explain to them my favorite parts and memories !  ! 
shawshank ,  godfather ,  pulp fiction .  .  .  all good films .  great films .  but nothing ,  and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all ,  santa claus .   the film is so great and has so many messages ,  i cried while watching it .  seriously ,  this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times .  when we see pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream ,  we see the sadness in his eyes ,  and we feel the deep sorrow ,  and then we wonder .  .  .  what is so bad about this ice cream ?  is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil ?  think movie makes you think .   this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever .  unlike other santas ,  he is a normal person .  we see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams ,  and we wonder ;  is the santa we believe in really that good ?  also ,  this santa actually mentions christ ,  the whole meaning behind christmas .   you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece .  we should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24/7 .  whether it's christmas or not ,  this movie gets a 500/10 .  whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool . 
this movie surprised me .  some things were  " clicheish "  and some technological elements reminded me of the movie  " enemy of the state "  starring will smith .  but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo  ( providing some comic relief )  .  this is a movie you can watch over again-say .  .  .  some wednesday night when nothing else is on .  i gave it a 9 for entertainment value . 
brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day christmas ceremonies .  the voyeuristic element during the scenes  ( santa & pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope )  is unique  ( and obviously jean-luc godard ,  although he was subtle ,  stole this theme in his film  " pierrot le-fou "  )  .  highly recommended ! 
this film was excellent ,  i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre .  this one however got all the ingredients ,  a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars !  i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi ,  and he sure did that a lot  :  ) 
this is definitely an appropriate update for the original ,  except that  " party on the left is now party on the right .  "  like the original ,  this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty .  it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous ,  and over-powerful federal government .  kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge ,  where the us government ,  with the cooperation of the mainstream media ,  threw around words like  " white supremacist "  and  " right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights ,  with the willing acquiescence of the general populace .  that message is so non-pc ,  i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick ,  katherine prudhomme ,  the western journalism center ,  and countless others who dared to speak out .   " live free or die "  is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays  " the voice ,  "  and that sums up the dangerous  ( to some )  message of this film .   
i really liked this version of 'vanishing point' as opposed to the 1971 version .  i found the 1971 version quite boring .  if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few times ( as i did with the 1971 version )  than to me ,  it is not all that great .  of course ,  this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out .  however ,  i have seen many remakes ,  where i have liked the original and older one better .  i found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version .  in my opinion ,  i felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so  " blase "  .  ( boring ) 
sure this was a remake of a 70's film ,  but it had the suspense and action of a current film ,  say breakdown .  he's running ,  desperate to be with his hospitalized wife ,  the police are the least concern .  the chases were very good ,  the part with him being  cornered at a rest stop was well done ,  the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger .  this is better than bullitt ,  a boring movie with what ,  a muscle car chase that was filmed badly ?  vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law ,  few movies had the effects-night vision ,  cb radio-okay i forgot the name of the movie ,  guy has 76'caddy souped up ,  toys with guy he upset .  the ending is great ,  you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not ,  a very good did-he-make-it-or-not . 
its not as good as the first movie , but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes , on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife , the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion ,   
sure ,  it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny ,  but at least the filmmakers didn't try .  while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity ,  this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it .  the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film ,  and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules .  most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy ,  but the scene with the mountain lion was intense .  i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock ,  but then again ,  it's a tv movie !  despite all of the good things ,  the soundtrack was atrocious .  however ,  it was nice to see tucson ,  arizona prominently featured in the film . 
spoilers through :    i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie .  it's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride .  i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating .   perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven't seen the original . something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus ,  have little to compare it to .  this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original .   there were a few things i liked about it .  one was the casting of kowalkski .  viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role .  since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders ,  he really needed to be excellent and he was .  this was a great role for him .   another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it's made for television .  i had no idea this was the case when watching it .  it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release .   i also found the story to be very absorbing .  i'm not one for action movies but i got sucked into this .  plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama ,  mysticism ,  a love story ,  quirky people every which way you turned .   ( i didn't even recognize priestly .  )  and it was touching .  this was not a great movie but it is watchable .   and then there's the ending .  it packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point ,  it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end .  i am not sure how i feel about the ending .  the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i'm highly skeptical of how that would be possible ,  it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie .   so i'd have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way ,  which i don't usually like but for some reason ,  is almost forgivable in this movie .  admittedly ,  a lot of things were just props for the plot ( could the villains have been anymore stereotypical ?  )  but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well .  however ,  having said that ,  i will admit i can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because ,  though i have not seen the original ,  i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results .   ( my big dislike is actually sequels .  )  but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality .   people have compared this to smoky and the bandit .  how about a road version of  " legends of the fall "  meets  " thelma and louese "  as well ?  i sure felt touches of both films ( both of which i'm a fan of .  )  i do not think however ,  that this was a great film .  it was better then average to me but far from great .  but it was an absorbing ,  adrenalin fueled ,  touching movie with excellent casting of the main character .  my vote is 7 of 10 . 
i have to agree with most of the other posts .  was it a comedy ?  a drama ?  to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side .  i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived .  jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name .  in new york ,  how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland . and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold .  again ,  a comedy or drama ?  but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning .  i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance ,  she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously .  she is a younger actress that is going to be viable . 
i have to say ,  i loved vanishing point .  i've seen the original ,  and this is a pretty good remake of it .  even though it didn't follow the original storyline  ( that's why i gave it 8 out of 10 )  ,  it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline .   as for the car ,  well the dj's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable  ( and if you look ,  the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150 )  ,  but even though i didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine ,  the original storyline had a supercharged hemi ,  so it's possible .  for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it ,  the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph ,  and if you look at that thing ,  going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph .  plus ,  in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic . 
to start off with ,  since this movie is a remake of a classic ,  the rating has to be lowered already .  since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski ,  it helps .   isn't this just like the united states government though ,  to terrorize one of its own citizens .  sounds like jason priestley's character from the movie !  but it is the truth ,  the government would do anything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to get home to his wife .  a wife ,  who is in labor no less ,  and may not make it .    " there was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife .  "  the words of the disc jockey .   there were some great shots of scenery in this film ,  and great car chases and a lot of spirituality .  after much consideration ,  i gave this film a 7 . 
any movie that shows federal pigs  ( persons in government )  to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me .   alas ,  the script supervision and editing and even ,  at times ,  the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments .   i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it ,  despised it ,  loathed it .  thought it was a terrible ,  irrational piece of junk .   now ,  though ,  i don't remember why .   i believe the two should not be compared or even connected .   consider them as two different movies .   rate them as two different movies .   this  " vanishing point "  provides a rallying place ,  a banner for people who want to encourage individualism ,  who believe in human rights ,  who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is ,  especially the federal government .    " the voice "  wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire :   " live free or die .  "  at one time it would have been the motto of most americans .   despite its obvious flaws ,   " vanishing point "  is a film to cheer . 
in canadian director kari skogland's film adaptation of the margaret laurence novel the stone angel ellen burstyn is hagar shipley ,  a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end ,  stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well-meaning son marvin .  filmed in manitoba ,  canada and set in the fictional town of manawaka ,  the stone angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in canadian high school english classes for almost half a century .   the title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on hagar's mother's grave which serves as a metaphor for hagar's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime .  burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego-driven ,  self-defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father ,  her well-meaning but alcoholic husband ,  and both of her sons .  as she nears the end of her days ,  she reflects that  " pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear .  i was alone ,  never anything else ,  and never free ,  for i carried my chains within me ,  and they spread out from me and shackled all i touched "  .   confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home ,  hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships ,  her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice-over narration .  the story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl .  chaperoned by her aunt dolly ,  she meets her future husband ,  the previously married bram shipley  ( cole/wings hauser )  ,  a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the native american population .  the young hagar is played by christine horne who is exceptional in her first feature role .  despite hagar's pleading ,  her relationship with bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot .  this is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of manawaka ,  condemning the young couple to a life of poverty .   going through the motions of her marriage to bram ,  hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town's upper classes .  when she produces two sons ,  marvin  ( dylan baker )  and john  ( kevin zegers )  ,  she is unable to give them the love that they need .   " every joy i might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning "  ,  she reflects ,   " all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearanceswhen did i ever speak the heart's truth ?  "  like the biblical hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride ,  hagar leaves manawaka to live in ontario but eventually returns to the shipley farm .   as the scene shifts back to the present ,  hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by marvin and his wife doris  ( sheila mccarthy )  ,  here she meets a young man named leo  ( luke kirby )  who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life .  the stone angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where i felt any stake in the story's outcome ,  although the spirited performance by ellen page as john's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film's second half . 
i saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in canada  ( still only in limited release )  .  it was worth the wait and then some .  i am a very avid reader of margaret laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film .  i actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel .  i liked that the character of bram shipley was a bit less harsh ,  and that there seemed to be more of a love story between hagar and bram ,  which made the scenes at the end of bram's life that much more moving .  the loss seemed stronger .  hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book ,  but ellen burstyn was a genius in this role .  she was hagar through and through .  christine horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead i am sure .  her scenes with cole hauser were electrifying .  i could go on and on ,  overall a 9 * out of 10 .  fantastic and can't wait for it to come out on dvd ,  a must own for my collection ! 
this movie is about basically human relations ,  and the interaction between them .  the main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past ,  doing an analysis of how she lived her life .  this journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home .  it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life ,  and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy ,  real love ,  marriage or destiny .  although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new ,  this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas .  there is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable ,  but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed .  i really recommend this movie for a quiet saturday afternoon . 
i was surprised at just how much i enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama ,  which owing to its rather unimpressive 6 . 6 rating ,  i nearly missed ;  as i rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 7/10 .  having said that ,  i'm so glad i gave stone angel the viewing it so very much deserved .  and so should you ,  if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive ,  soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form .   i must say that in many ways  ( though not all )  ,  viz .  its themes ,  execution ,  style ,  production etc .  ,  stone angel very much reminded me of the much praised  " the notebook "  .  i am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie ,  so i can only assume that those who've written comments have yet to see the notebook .  they may not share any alzheimer's theme ,  yet i can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed  " the notebook "  you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with  " the stone angel "  .  but even if you've not seen the notebook ,  nor read the book on which this move is based ,   ( which ,  incidentally ,  i haven't either )  you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly - as long as your favourite genres don't include fast paced action thrillers .  this is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time's passing ,  how life changes as the years pass ,  and what might have happened in one's life as one gazes back through the years .   this bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8/10 .  i can only blame its current lowish rating of 6 . 6/10 on the 11% of idiots who gave it 1/10 .  after all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment .  nonetheless ,  if those 11% who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn't they look .  .  .  for even a few seconds at the movie's premise and promotional lines ?  oh dear .  .  .  whatever the world is coming to ,  don't miss this most underrated gem of a movie - but only *if* you have a brain  ( i . e .  ,  your top ten doesn't include transformers ,  fight club nor the terminator )  . 
i saw this film in winnipeg recently - appropriate ,  given the location used .  i first read lawrence's book back in the 70's and for me ,  it's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society .  it resonated when i was young ,  and it resonates even more now .  when the film came out ,  i was keen to see if the story could survive .  and was thoroughly impressed ,  especially with ellen burstyn's performance .  she manages to give us a complete human being ,  even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental - someone that you wouldn't want to live with .  it's great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically . 
as perhaps one of the few canadians who did not read the book in high school ,  i thought i would add my comments .  seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film .  the characters have so many complexities ,  everyone can relate to them in their own way .  the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters ,  rather than being spoon-fed an opinion .  you can love them or dislike them ,  and still feel the emotional impact of the movie .  wonderful performances by ellen burstyn and christine horne really bring the characters to life .  i'd highly recommend it . 
i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents ,  i really connected .  it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate .  and then there's the mistakes they made and have to live with .  i loved ellen burstyn's performance and who is christine horne ?  she's fantastic !  a real find .  there is probably the most erotic scene i've ever seen in a film ,  yet nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done .  overall the look and feel of the film was stunning ,  a real emotional journey .  cole hauser is very very good in this picture ,  he humanizes a man spiraling downwards .  i liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life ,  never sentimental ,  never too much - just enough to hook us in ,  but not enough to bog down . 
this is a really interesting movie .  it is an action movie with comedy mixed in .  foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin .  it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next .  it was a well shot movie ,  the director used the right colors in this movie ( dark blue colors )  to give it the right kind of feel .  kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen .  she plays her role well .  even jamie kennedy is in this movie .  it's worth seeing it you haven't seen it .  it's definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan .  it deserves more credit than it is actually given . 
what i loved about the on-screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel !  great film !  as an avid reader ,  i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation .  you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film .   ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar .  however ,  i think the canadian actress  ( christine horne )  chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise .  i haven't seen any of horne's previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance .   i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008 .  i can't wait to see it on the big screen again ! 
i had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently .  i believe that it will be in theaters in canada some time around mother's day .  if it is in a theater near you .  .  .  go !  it's not a funny feel-good movie - it's more along the lines of a feel and think movie .   the director does an excellent job of character development - letting you into the heart ,  mind and hurts of hagar little by little .  at first ,  her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense .  as her story unfolds ,  she becomes someone you can understand .  as in life .  .  .  understanding brings empathy .  i found her likable by the end of the movie - particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake .   hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful - and reflective of so many of our own experiences in this world .  her youngest son ,  john ,  who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat - and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare .   it's fun to see ellen page acting in this movie .  she is so very different than the young woman that she plays in juno .  it gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting ability .  if you loved her in juno ,  you'll love her in the stone angel .   of course ,  there is ellen burnstyn as hagar .  there is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played .  never once in the course of this movie did i ever think of ellen burnstyn - i always and only thought of hagar .  she swept me into her character - hook ,  line and sinker .   kari skogland's capacity to capture on film this renowned book by one of canada's most cherished authors is impressive .  she brilliantly brings to the screen both the stoney and angelic parts of this complex woman ,  hagar - the stone angel . 
a christmas together actually came before my time ,  but i've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family's christmas music .  for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas .  a few years ago ,  i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay ,  so after listening to all the music for some 21 years ,  i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself .  if you ever get the chance ,  it's a lot of fun--great music ,  heart-warming and cheesy .  it's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today .  i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--i guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the muppets ,  but i'm glad he did .  even if you can't track down the video ,  the soundtrack is worth it too .  it has some muppified traditional favorites ,  but also some original denver tunes as well . 
i saw the movie recently and really liked it .  i surprised myself and cried .  this movie is in the same niche genre as  " away from her "  - or even  " the bucket list "  but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity .  it's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar .  the director does a masterful job with the challenge .  hagar's hard to understand .  her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all .   the first scene gets this across without any compromise .  hagar  ( ellen burnstyn )  is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law .  she figures it out en-route and freaks out .  her edges are really hard .  she is mean .  she is belittling and selfish .  she is a stone .  i didn't like her - not even a little bit .   throughout the course of the movie ,  we get insight .  we find out why she doesn't like petunias ,  why she favors one son over the other ,  how her losses have formed her character .  .  .  i started to see the angel .  .  .  and i started to like her .  i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack .  ellen burnstyn ,  you are a brilliant actor .  kudos .  kudos .  kudos .  what a scene !   this isn't a  " feel good "  movie ,  but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy .  i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect ,  they are there for a reason .  .  .   hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor .  .  .  but parts of her are present in many women  ( and men )  in my life .  those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i've watched the stone angel . 
i am amazed at how this movie ( and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on imdb .  the fanboy mentality strikes again .  when this movie came out just about everyone slammed it .  even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable .  years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying .  even laughing quite a bit .  this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people labeling the director antoine fuqua as the black michael bay .  i don't see how since most of fuqua's movies are smarter than anything michael bay has came up with .  at any rate .  .  .   story :  alvin sanders ( jamie foxx )  is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense treasury agent edgar ( david morse )  as a pawn to catch a killer named bristol ( doug hutchinson )  .  alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident .  while these agents are after bristol ,  bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry .   jamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders .  alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on .  doug hutchinson is okay as bristol .  he can be over-the-top sometimes in his john malkovitchesque demeanor .  he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in punisher :  war zone .  david morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent .  even mike epps is funny as alvin's brother stevie .  both him and jamie had some funny moments on screen .   the only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat .  the scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but i couldn't look away .  the director went all out there so he gets points for that .  plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty .   all in all bait is not a bad movie by a long shot .  its never boring ,  its always funny and i wasn't checking my watch every minute .  that should count for something .  bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period .   ps :  to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent .  .  .  .  how long have you been living under a rock ?  i'm pretty sure you've seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino .  but those movies aren't violent right ?  weirdo . 
i thought this movie was hysterical .  i have watched it many times and recommend it highly .  mel brooks ,  was excellent .  the cast was fantastic .  . i don't understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating .  i loved it .  .  i have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor .  .  his i just can't say enough about this movie .  i look for it to be on periodically but it never on enough for me .  the people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also .  please put this movie on more often .  i can't see it enough .  . leslie ann warren also was another favorite of mine ,  ever since cinderella .  i always thought that she wasn't really funny but loved her acting .  in this movie she was very funny .  . and her and mel did a great job together .  they should put more of his movies on tv . 
 .  .  . this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss .  nice story ,  funny riches-to-rags situations ,  mel brooks is not a bad lead ,  maybe not perfect but he is funny  ; d don't pay attention to the rating ,  it's bs .  watch it ,  then watch something like final destination  ( 2009 )  and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating .  if you do ,  i don't think we can be friends xd at this point i recommend the fourth season of  " curb your enthusiasm "  to every brooks fan  ;  )  vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms !  i've to make 10 lines here to post a comment ?  i don't wanna write a book here  : p
the most hillarious and funny brooks movie i ever seen .  i can watch and re-watch the tape 100 times .  i laugh my a** off and i cry on some moments .  it is really good and funny movie ,  and if you like brooks - this is a must !  in short - brooks  ( billionare )  gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor .  the reality bites ,  but in the end - it is about warm relations between humans .  .  .  hightly recommend ! 
 " life stinks "  is a parody of life and death ,  happiness and depression .  the black and the white always present in our lives .  mel brooks performance is brilliant as always ,  and the other actors work is fine too .  this movie has some capra flavor ,  that´s why is so good .   there are some unforgettable gags such as the one when brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street ,  and all the people passing by just ignore him ,  or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is paul getty and then start arguing and slapping each other .   if you haven´t seen it ,  you don´t know what you´ve missed .   this movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich .    the only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending ,  and reality hasn´t .   yes indeed ,  life stinks . 
this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine ,  the fire on ,  and with your feet up .  it doesn't require that much brain-power to follow ,  so is very good after a long day .  i would say it is very unrealistic - if you expecting anything serious ,  then don't bother ,  but it is very funny .  just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while ,  and then actually get to enjoy it .  .  .  i would definitely recommend it . 
i have not read the other comments on the film ,  but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary .   i watched it for the second time with my children .  they absolutely loved it .  true ,  it did not have the adults rolling around the floor ,  but the sound of the children's enjoyment made it seem so .   it is a true mel brooks farce ,  with plenty of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money ,  not for whom we are ,  and how fickle are our friends and associates .  there are many other films on a similar subject matter ,  no doubt ,  many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults .  it's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family ,  however .   hence ,  for the children ,  a 9/10 from me . 
life stinks  ( 1991 )  was a step below mel brooks other productions .  he stars as a rich man who wages an insane wager with his  " friends "  .  brooks claims that he can life like a homeless man for a month .  his shocked and amused friends accept this unusual wager .  during his  " stay "  in the bowery ,  he meets a bunch of odd homeless people ,  one of them catches his fancy  ( lesley-ann warren )  .  they strike up a friendship as she teaches him the many tricks she learned whilst living on the street .  can mr .  brooks survive on his own without the luxuries of being filthy rich ?  will he win this unorthodox wager ?  who are his true friends ?  find out when you watch life stinks to find out !   this film has been slagged unfairly .  sure it's not a classic like his earlier films but it's still enjoyable .  i liked the way mel brooks pays homage to charles chaplin in this film .  if you have watched chaplin's earlier silent films then you'll get the humor as well .   recommended for mel brooks fans . 
seeing as the vote average was pretty low ,  and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was  " just ok "  ,  i didn't have much expectations when renting this film .   but contrary to the above ,  i enjoyed it a lot .  this is a charming movie .  it didn't need to grow on me ,  i enjoyed it from the beginning .  mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character ,  i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies .   there's not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that ,  but there are some rather hilarious scenes ,  and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film .   very recommended . 
the plot had some wretched ,  unbelievable twists .  however ,  the chemistry between mel brooks and leslie ann warren was excellent .  the insight that she comes to ,   " there are just moments ,  "  provides a philosophical handle by which anyone could pick up ,  and embrace ,  life .   that was one of several moments that were wonderfully memorable .
