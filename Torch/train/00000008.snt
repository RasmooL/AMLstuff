Jeppe Aakjaer
(1866-1930), Danish writer, a leading regional and social-protest author from the Jutland peninsula, who is read today as a lyric poet rather than as a novelist.
The novel Vredens børn, et tyendes saga (Children of Wrath: A Hired Man's Saga, 1904) helped bring some small improvements for rural workers.
Rugens sange (Songs of the Rye, 1906) is his best-known work.
He became known as the Danish Burns because his work somewhat resembles that of the Scottish poet Robert Burns.
